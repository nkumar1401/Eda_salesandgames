Mario Kart Wii retains the traditional item-based weaponry familiar with the franchise, where players can select a Mario franchise driver and themed vehicles. As with most racing games, the overarching goal is to place first among other competitors, through the usage of such items and taking the fastest routes to secure the leads. Several new key elements introduced to Mario Kart Wii include increasing the number of racers to 12 racers from 8 racers from previous entries in the series, as well as introducing a new type of vehicle to the franchise: bikes. The game takes advantage of features unique to the Wii, most notably its motion control capabilities. A Wii Wheel is included in most Mario Kart Wii packages, though the game is still compatible with other controllers. Game modes are also present such as the traditional Grand Prix, Versus, Battle, and Time Trial modes.","completed to fulfill a childhood dream and its genuinely fun racing. grand prix mode can be infuriating if youre trying to get star ratings though the worst mario kart. the sort of thing a reprobate would come up with for fun. motion controls can die. solid mariokart entry but i always found myself going back to double dash. skill issue its the wii one everyones played this one its a fun mario kart, i dont really like the motion controls but it does have funky kong funky music too i used to deeply dislike mario kart wii. the controls felt unresponsive and wrong and the item balancing seemed nonexistent to me.",19000.0,88.0,461.0,168.0,3.8241011278286714,2.744047619047619,2008

Dungeon exploration is somewhat more puzzle-oriented than in earlier games but they are not too complex.","i was a dumb kid that got progress locked in the water temple and didnt understand i did something wrong. i have a bad habit of not beating video games. even though i havent beaten ocarina of time, ive gotten far enough into it to tell that its good, and if you need me to tell you that its good then youre a bit of a silly little guy, a goober if you will as years go by, i still enjoy this succesful transition from 2d to 3d of the series, but its rather formulaic structure make me prefer bolder approaches such as subsequent episodes. childhood game and probably played it about 8 times through, timeless classic remaster is good too but never finished it i love this game. but you know what. ive never actually finished it. can i justifiably give this game a higher review if i havent even bloody finished it. i just love the idea of it. this is so stupid. what is anything anymore. the very last fight against ganon not ganondorf felt so good. nintendo knows how to make a game. it felt very powerful and i nearly shedded a tear.",17000.0,433.0,3000.0,1400.0,4.191099860483846,2.142857142857143,1998

              Perhaps the most noticeable change from Tekken 2 fight system is movement reform - whereas the element of depth had been largely insignificant in previous Tekken games (aside from some characters having unique sidesteps and dodging maneuvers), Tekken 3 added emphasis on the third axis, allowing all characters to sidestep in or out of the background by lightly pressing the arcade stick (or tapping the controller button in the console version) towards the corresponding direction. Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn't connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws.
             

              Tekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat 'em up minigame called ""Tekken Force"", which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first). This was continued in Tekken 4 and succeeded by the Devil Within minigame in Tekken 5 - but Boskonovitch was dropped as a playable character after Tekken 3. There is also a minigame ""Tekken Ball"", similar to beach volleyball, where one has to hit the ball with a powerful attack to hurt the opponent or try to hit the ball in such a way that it hits the ground in the opponent's area, thus causing damage.","deserves the praises that it gets. revolutionized the 3d fighting game genre, and is basically the street fighter 2 for 3d fighters. youd think that after tekken 2 set the bar so high, that there would be nowhere to go but down from here, but they just kept making the game even better. we have an entirely new fresh set of characters here, the gameplay has been polished to a fine sheen, and theres a ton of bonus modes you can play that inadvertently give you practice for the main fighting mode, which is awesome since the normal training mode labbing can sometimes not be everyones cup of tea. the other gamemodes also give lonely fighters like myself much more to do than just playing arcade mode and getting clapped by dumb ai enemies over and over. this is pretty much the golden standard of tekken, and theres a reason why this game is rated so highly not just among tekken games, but even among fighting game titles and overall ps1 games. the first truly 3d fighting game, you can get some really spectacular fights especially if you know what youre doing which i dont. unfortunately the spectacle is reserved for a fraction of the characters. a quarter of the roster is complete dogshit, and another quarter is just kinda meh. playing a character as bland as nina after flipping and kicking around with eddy is just too jarring. i need a hero and jin is the hero in this game. 55 just kinda love the style of this. the soundtrack is awesome and the characters are awesome and i love sidestepping a huge step up from the last two entries of the series. the ai can be challenging, but not unfair and the combat feels so smooth. the side modes in this game are really fun, tekken force being a great addition. the cinematics are great and tell fun stories while also boasting a big step up visually compared to its predecessor. tekken 3 really is still worth trying, even over 20 years later.",4200.0,13.0,253.0,183.0,3.791336862218077,1.3825136612021858,1997

Each player has a damage total, represented by a percentage, which rises as the damage is taken.","lil moustache man what you punching your friends for solid foundation for the juggernaut that is smash bros. today. gameplay is fine but lacks content compared to future entires. muito divertido. possui mais limpo de entender e acompanhar em uma boa parte dos mapas e na gameplay. porém como se trata do começo da franquia, a balanceamento e a otimização das mecânicas não é muito bom. ponto que incomda muito os controles do n64 são horríveis e o jogo aidna não faz bom uso do analógico deles. still holds up great even if the controls leave a little to be desired. plenty of single player content too with board the platforms, break the targets, and classic mode. smash 64 doesnt really have a lot of content in it ngl but its still dang fun all things considered and also helped start the wacky nonsense that is the modern smash brothers ip. if you bust this out at a party, theres going to be a good time. though if you are more used to the later smash games, youll probably get bored pretty soon. this website is ridiculous but its ok i forgive you",9800.0,20.0,279.0,207.0,3.499867928430563,1.3478260869565217,1999

The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (""badniks"" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground.
             

              Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection.
             

              The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress.
             

              At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues).
             

              When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a ""Secret Zone"" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a ""goal block"" (which ends the level).","recomendado, pero tener en cuenta que es la 1era entrega. no lo tenian todo atado the one that started it all and what a way to kick things off. a household gem of the sega systems and the source of many childhood memories for me. depois desse jogo..... teve vários outros jogos bons do sonic. divertido e simples, tudo que eu gosto. lixo, jogo desgraçado level design pavoroso dps da green hill zone detestei e foi uma das experiencias que mais me irritou nessa franquia inteira e olha que eu joguei sonic 2006 a masterpiece of design more than it is an actually great game. at the same time, if youre competing with mario, being able to have a style and sound profile that burns itself into a young mind is the only way to gain ground, since its gonna be really hard to make up that distance mechanically.",12000.0,60.0,804.0,243.0,3.2597996318501026,3.308641975308642,1991

One key aspect introduced in this title is the simultaneous multiplayer: while not the first game in the series to do so, it is the first 3D title in the Mario series to incorporate up to four players cooperating with each other to reach the goal. Players can select their character from a pool of playable characters prior to starting the game, and each of these characters have their own unique playstyle that gives them advantages and disadvantages over other characters. The game makes use of several Wii U exclusive features, such as tapping blocks with the touch screen on the GamePad and blowing into the mic to reveal hidden items and blow away enemies.

The game begins with the player controlling the child Link, but later on an adult Link becomes a playable character as well and each of them has certain unique abilities. Ocarina of Time also introduces the use of music to solve puzzles: as new songs are learned, they can be used to solve puzzles, gain access to new areas and warp to different locations.

Most of the gameplay mechanics introduced in Ground Zeroes are carried over: it is still an action game and stealth oriented but replaces the linear corridor design from most earlier titles with large open world environments that offer the player unrestricted freedom for the approach. The world has now a real-time day and night cycle and various weather effects that influence enemy behaviour, visibility and sound. Sabotaging or destroying certain structures can also influence other parts of the map.","kojima i love you please have my children story will leave you with actual phantom pain but the gameplay is unmatched in the action stealth genre. preparing for missions and utilizing all the unique gear are the best parts of mgsv. the game does nothing to justify its open world structure though and adds unnecessary grinding for materials to upgrade your base which bogs down the gameplay. its hard to review this game. it has the best gameplay in the series, easily, but thats constantly interrupted by helicopter rides, visits to mother base, selecting your loadouts even though, for me, it was the same loadout for almost every mission and micromanaging your many recruits. still, while youre actually in the field, the stealth gameplay feels excellent. but then it has the absolute worst story in the series. on the plus side... kinda... the vast majority of the story is on cassette tapes that are completely optional. only 1015 hours into this game and already its one of my favorites of all time. let me illustrate why via some comparisons. average call of duty mission walk in a straight line. kill some people. average f.e.a.r. mission walk in a straight line until you reach an arena where you will move around strategically and kill some people. average far cry 34 mission drive across the world until you reach the location. hide on a hill and snipe every bad guy at the base, then walk inside. or sneak inside, i dont care. this funnels you into a segment where you walk forward and kill people. average msgv mission you have 15 minutes to destroy enemy vehicles. their path is marked on your pip boy. call in a supply drop for a grenade launcher up ahead, then ride on your horse to get ahead of a tank, pick up the grenade launcher, and ambush the tank. next, ride across a bridge to the other side of a river, plant some c4, set up an ammo drop, go prone, and wait for another vehicle to pass by so you can blow it up. next, you get a message that a jeep is transporting a prisoner you need to extract. its across the river. user your sniper rifle to kill the driver and guard, run across the river, extract the prisoner, park the jeep in the middle of the road so that it stops the next vehicle that is coming your way. find a place to hide so you can ambush the vehicle. this is just the first half of the mission. and if you die, you can approach it a completely different way. this game feels like it takes far cry 4 and turns every gameplay element except for the open world up to 11. instead of just shutting down the radios at a base, you can destroy their comms equipment, their antiair radar, and their electrical power. dont just shut off the lightsshut off the lights, plant c4 on the power source, and then blow up the guy who comes by to turn the lights on. but be careful, because the enemies will react to anything you do. keep turning the lights off and they will start wearing nightvision goggles. the amount of things you can do in this game is amazing. even though the game is relatively difficult for me, anyway, it always feels fair. its always clear what killed me, and successfully completing a mission is less a matter of just getting better at doing a specific thing and more a matter of changing tactics. enemy behavior is some of the most realistic and immersive ive seen in a stealth game. sure, you can cheese the ai, but you really have to work for it, instead of just going round the corner so the enemies forget your presence. it really does feel like living through an awesome action movie rather than playing a video game. i only have a few complaints. one is that the open world really is empty theres nothing besides enemy bases. i wouldnt so much call this an open world game as an open arena game or a semisandbox game or something equally clunky. the goal of the open world in this game is not so much to simulate a living, breathing world like skyrim or far cry 4, but to give you a large area of operations for your missions. it succeeds in that regard, but i do wish there had been some more dynamic events happening. my other complaint is with the base management portion of the gameit feels like a mobile game, and takes away from the action. i want to be sneaking around and shooting stuff, not clicking through a menu. these are small complaints, however, and i can safely say that this game is one of the best games i have ever played. since the game regularly goes on sale for a steep discount, i heartily recommend buying it. one more thing you can put your own music into the game to play through your pokedex or on the helicopter. theres nothing quite as iconic as blasting through a base while back in black blares through the stereo, or having your chopper play born in the usa every time it picks you up. release the kojimas cut",14000.0,503.0,4500.0,1200.0,3.766521187482147,3.75,2015

The player moves about the game through still images of locations. The player can use the DS touchscreen to tap on non-player characters to start a dialog or to obtain a puzzle, and also can search anywhere on the background for hint coins, with some areas needing to be tapped several times to reveal a secret hint coin or puzzle. Puzzles are brainteasers of many varieties, including visual, math, and logic. There is no time limit to solve puzzles, and the player can get up to 3 hints at a cost of one hint coin each; a new feature in Unwound Future is a ""super hint"", costing 2 coins, that can only be bought after the other 3 hints have been revealed, but that nearly reveals the puzzle's solution. If the player is correct in solving the puzzle, they gain a number of ""Picarats"", a form of currency within the game. Guessing the incorrect answer will reduce the number of picarats the player can get on subsequent attempts. Players can visit certain areas in order to play undiscovered or unsolved puzzles that are left behind as the story progresses.","1010 would cry again man what a great game, by far the best in the series so far the game was a joy to play, the story was great and even tho i was spoiled out of context i knew there was a twist, but the game was great, the ending even made me cry which few games make me cry. the puzzles were great and varied with lots of different side modes to do. muchos puzzles de relojes, una ambientación que no llega a la altura de st. mystère o folsense, pero lo compensa con creces dando desarrollo y puñaladas emocionales. el mas mejor de los layton, pero con razon este es apodado profesor layton y el trauma emocional the puzzles, characters, story and everything are at their best in this game. its a step up from the previous 2 and is probably one of the best games ive ever played after hearing that unwound future was unanimously considered the best out of the series, i decided to give professor layton one last chance. but even still, i just really can not wrap my head around what is so enjoyable about these games. i want to like it so, so badly. i can see the good parts, like the art and the music and the atmosphere, but its almost like the game uses that to masquerade as a better experience than it is. i look at professor layton and i think, wow, what a charming little world but playing through unwound future was one of the most miserable experiences ive ever had with a game, of course.",2400.0,33.0,664.0,388.0,3.950303678204197,1.711340206185567,2008

Interactive Entertainment, which takes place in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Legendarium.
             

              The game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life.
             

              The game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor.
             

              The melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm, using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player's combo multiplier.
             

              A unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory. These enemies will continue to do their own jobs and tasks even when they're off screen. If the player does not kill an enemy in an encounter, this enemy will remember the player and change their tactics and conversations based on the encounter.","it has combat from arkham and assassins creed, climbing from uncharted, stealth from every 7th gen third person game, you spend half of the time clearing out bandit camps, and you play the most ai generated character in all of gaming. im sure we all remember that iconic lord of the rings characters name. this is a game so derivative of every other game around it that it lacks any identity and purpose to exist. monolith is an underrated company. fear was an underrated franchise in general, although the 3rd kind of fell flat. luckily they managed to claim some of the respect they were due with this game. a jogabilidade é muito boa o jogo tem um sistema de combate bem dinâmico, com muitos movimentos e habilidades que você pode aprender ao longo do jogo. além disso, o jogo tem o sistema nêmesis, onde os inimigos que você enfrenta vão se lembrar de você e evoluir de acordo com suas ações e para mim é o ponto alto do jogo. honestly not even that good of a game but i had a blast with the nemesis system and i enjoyed doing mindless treasure huntingrepetitive missions just because i liked making uruks feel as much pain as possible. would recommend to family and friends. its assassins creed in middle earth. whats not to love the nemesis system is still, to this day, one of the coolest things ive ever seen in a video game and its a shame that wb has done nothing with it since. disclaimer these are my brief thoughts based on my memory of playing this 8 years ago manswine",8400.0,106.0,1700.0,478.0,3.516752815299235,3.5564853556485354,2014

The game borrows elements from the original Sonic the Hedgehog titles for the Sega Genesis, but with the post-Dreamcast artstyle for the characters which was introduced in Sonic Adventure.

It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989.
             

              The Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards.
             

              The game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010). A remastered, high-definition, version of The Sands of Time was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on November 16, 2010.","prince of persia the sands of time is without question one of the most influential platformers ever made. its easy to trace its legacy during play. moments where ledges fall away, revealing a specific path for the prince to climb on, or removing pieces of scaffolding that the player balances on have been redone again and again and again. uncharted , god of war , tomb raider , jedi fallen order , and many more all follow in the example that this game set, if in an extremely diluted way. so, does this original version stand up to the test of time i would say it does fairly well. gamecube was such a good era this game is considered a classic and it deserves to be. it does go on a little longer than id like, and the combat is a little barebones, but thats about it. i was one of the idiots that played this game on steam. its an awful windows game, as it is heavily bugged and requires a lot of time and effort to make it playable. however, i gave it another go since i acquired the steam deck. playing this game through proton actually fixes a lot of the issues with playing the game on a modern windows system. you would still have to do a couple of things to get it working as if it was native to the system, but the amount of effort required is much less on the steam deck than a modern windows machine. esses jogos sao mto subestimados polished yet monotonous. after the initial exposition youre left going from platforming to combat for hours without a single drop of narrative. progressing through the game is fun though, so if you dont pay much attention to story either way have a blast. id argue this game couldve been inspiration for the uncharted series as theres plenty of parallels.",5500.0,37.0,1100.0,421.0,3.6259721715337565,2.6128266033254155,2003

It is the first entry in the NBA Jam series. The main designer and programmer for this game was Mark Turmell. Midway had previously released such sports games as Arch Rivals in 1989, High Impact in 1990, and Super High Impact in 1991. The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.
              
              The game became exceptionally popular, and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release, creating revenue of $1 billion in quarters. In early 1994, the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.
              
              The release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz), and hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge).","the console ports of this game dont suffer from the coinmunching syndrome that is plagueing the arcade. fun to play especially against another human, otherwise the ai cheats way too much to make it fun for long. i cannot, and will never, condone an arcade game that is asking you for more money even when you win. u will never find a better basketball game maybe nba street but never forget where u came from there was a local restaurant called shillelaghs that had this game as an arcade cabinet when i was a kid. i didnt even like the food really. i would just want to go to play the game. i didnt even like basketball. just that good of a game. had loads of fun with this gem of a basketball game. i always played as the wolf player. que excelente era cuando lo mejor que habia en cuanto a multijugador de a 4 se trataba, era un juego de basquet sin reglas reales y con personajes que podían saltar 10 metros. eramos felices y no lo sabíamos",847.0,0.0,64.0,23.0,3.6435692587685846,2.782608695652174,1993

Mario and friends are invited to the Baseball Kingdom to play games against each other. When Bowser hears this, he immediately interrupts the party.
             

              There are several game modes to choose from like in the previous game. In Exhibition mode, players play a single game against each other. Players can choose different options such as how many innings to play, if captains can use star powers (each captain has a different star swing and pitch), and toggle error items off and on (error items can be thrown at fielders).
             

              The single-player Challenge mode is different this time around. Instead of choosing a team captain, players start with Mario who must find teammates to take on Bowser Jr. and Bowser. Teammates aren't unlocked by playing a game rather they only join the team by clearing certain objectives. Most of the action takes place on areas with an overhead perspective; each area is based around a team captain. Each captain has a special ability to find teammates and coins, which are used to buy items to aid in the quest or in a game against Bowser Jr. or later against Bowser. More coins can be gotten in minigames.
             

              Toy Field mode is slightly different to the one featured in Mario Superstar Baseball. Like in the GameCube game, players take turns batting to get points; a turn is granted to whomever grabs and holds the ball after a certain amount of time has passed. Unlike in the previous game, however, fielders can attack each other to steal the ball away from whomever has it. The batter can also throw items at the fielders to cause them to drop the ball and grant the batter another turn.","make another mario baseball game its baseball but with all of the standard mario fun packed in. i never played the original so i wouldnt know if its better or worse, but this game is good, not amazing but good. shake the wii remote the game. i liked this game a lot when i was a kid, but when i came back to it with my brother and we realized just how much wagglin we were really doing it took a bit of the excitement away. the game is also pretty broken in terms of game balance, its wayyyy too easy to crack home run after home run. i think the presentation of the game is cool though, the roster has a lot of interesting characters to make your team out of, and you can even play during both the day and night which i always thought was cool. the stadiums to play in are super unique with fun gimmicks and aesthetics in each of them. its a fun mario baseball game, but not as good as its predecessor. this is the only sports game i actually enjoy. i have so many memories of playing this as a kid with my younger brother each moment was bliss any game that i had fun with as a kid and that my friends still enjoy playing today already starts at 3 and a half stars for me. this game has so much love put into it and it is amazing how much fun can be had when there is really only one game mode i care about. this game has a great roster and there are so many hidden gems such as toadsworth. as soon as i learned how good of a pitcher he is i managed to piss off my friend so bad that he jumped on me in real life. you can play without rng, but having a little bit is a fun way to add some variety to the game and get angry reactions from friends which is always fun. even the single player campaign is fun. my friends who grew up with it get a lot more out of it than anyone new to the game. other party games that i have feel more accesable to new players. that is a very minor gripe, however, and the game still deserves a very high rating. good game, but not as good as super mario baseball from gamecube",1800.0,4.0,133.0,81.0,3.665693206745006,1.6419753086419753,2008

The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the few upcoming ally and enemy turns are shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's ""boost"" gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts.
             

              Each character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS.","definitely more cutscene than game here, i wasnt doing much with the controller through this game. however, the plot and characters are really neat and the game definitely kept me on the edge of my seat as i watched the cool space shenanigans that the party goes through. this game does an incredible job at introducing the world and characters in a way where i really got to know them but at the same time still was intrigued by the backstories and future that they would have in later games. plot and cutscenes are 910. references to xenogears are neat. gameplay is mid and boring, and slow god bless turbo button. even tho i somehow enjoyed stats synchronization mechanic, but i think its not a feature, but an overlooked game design flaw  wont complain, being op is funny. also didnt like too easy to miss stuff  forgot to return to the room you left right now  you will miss entire sidequest with generous reward. also game has really obscure secrets where you need to be in particular place controlling particular character them being in your party isnt enough. my favorite one is playground in the beginning of the dungeon, you need to travel for about 20 minutes, just to get a card for a hidden minigame. it feels like they made it for replayability, but again in the end of the game there is a big middle finger for those who will decide to save clear data on the same save slot. because you cant load clear data  its for sequel to get few bonuses swimsuits and something else. theres no ng, theres no way to start from checkpoint before final boss, you just wasted all your progress. you also lose access to all minigames  therefore gameplay is 310 i dont remember any music during gameplay but in cutscenes it was good  710 interesting space opera which is unfortunately attached to a video game. but at least the video game has an in game glossary snoooooooooze boooooring miiiiiiiiid dnf, wish i did my personal fav of the 3",1200.0,103.0,1300.0,575.0,3.676049220093541,2.260869565217391,2002

It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support, but in August 2014, the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive.
             

              Until Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the ""Butterfly Effect"" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player's choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has ""hundreds of endings"". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game.
             

              The gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.
             

              Until Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story, mostly the second half, camera angles, character movements and partially linear plot.","sam i dont like this game. ive seen it all the way through like 4 times camp played before 2023 probably the game with the best choices in this narrativedriven style game where the choices do matter, even if they dont create much branching paths. the coolest part about this game is that, depending on your choices, everyone can survive or everyone can die and you dont really get that in many other games. i think it also had an okay story, feeling very stereotypical to make it easy for them to create characters. voice acting and performances are okay, but there is nothing interesting about the gameplay. qtes being essentially the only aspect of these type of games is fine, but they arent really done in interesting ways and there isnt much else outside of this. the areas you are walking around arent super interactable in heavy rain, and they arent wellpaced to explore like in twd. qtes are evil and i was going to give this 2 stars until i remembered that i didnt move my controller, i swear watched a playthrough of this and doesnt seem like itll change much if i play it. characters were interesting albeit kind of assholes lmao. enjoyable scares and different scenario possibilities are also really interesting to check out.",8000.0,85.0,1200.0,585.0,3.4900240308746087,2.051282051282051,2015

              To progress through the story, the player battle enemies throughout levels. The game utilizes a health system in which players' health is divided into separate sections that regenerate; if an entire section is lost, the player must use a health pack to replenish the missing health. In combat, a cover system can be used as assistance against enemies. The player have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which can be used as a tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives the player a wide variety of weapon optionsâ€”they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around.","ätopyasä harika olan bir oyun kaã oyun var ki almanlar dã¼nya savaåÿänä kazanäyor ve dã¼nyaya hã¼kmediyor, ã¼stã¼ne bunu yã¼ksek bã¼tãe ile anlatäyor mã¼kemmel. oynanäåÿä harika, hikayeyi anlatäåÿä harika, tek kiåÿilik bir orduyuz. nzi mimarisini gã¼zel yansätmäåÿ, silahlarä gã¼zel, evreni gã¼zel oynayän. i dream of burgers and dogs fergus its a pretty good single player fps, heard a lot of good stuff, but it doesnt really do anything special both in terms of narrative and gameplay. decent enough single player fps. doesnât do anything too special but nothing stands out as bad. my second fave wolfenstein, after return. first game i bought when i got my ps4 and it was jaw dropping. just a dope console shooter. wish i could play more from this series but this is genuinely so scary i cant ðÿðÿðÿðÿ i was made for baby games",8400.0,149.0,2200.0,722.0,3.6193953474518215,3.0470914127423825,2014

The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.
             

              Guitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero.
             

              The game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game.","its a game. its guitar hero. if you like guitar hero, you are gonna like this. the setlist is relatively diverse, albiet maybe a bit more leaning towards pop music over metal and rock. i heard beforehand that this game was the straw that apparently broke the camels back and made guitar hero more leaning to casuals, and i can kind of see that but also not really most of the setlist was very easy but the last few songs are still good fun. this game also has a completely revamped graphics engine which looks very good in action, so thats neat. there are also bonus challenges for certain songs that are actually really difficult, so gh maniacs still have fun things to do i feel. overall, its more guitar hero. you cant go wrong with guitar hero, though i can see why constant releases of just more guitar hero would definitely fatigue the audience into the franchises decline. major rhythm game fatigue hit right about here. kurt cobain cantando y.m.c.a. kkkkk muito foda completo this is the installment where even i got tired of the yearly bullshit. not the best but its still fun.",1100.0,0.0,65.0,22.0,3.5977411214936317,2.9545454545454546,2009

In the sequel, Starkiller returns with over-the-top Force powers and embarks on a journey to discover his own identity and to reunite with his one true love, Juno Eclipse.
             

              In Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, Starkiller is once again the pawn of Darth Vader — but instead of training his protégée as a ruthless assassin, the dark lord is attempting to clone his former apprentice in an attempt to create the Ultimate Sith warrior. The chase is on — Starkiller is in pursuit of Juno and Darth Vader is hunting for Starkiller.
             

              With all-new devastating Force powers and the ability to dual-wield lightsabers, Starkiller cuts a swath through deadly new enemies across exciting worlds from the Star Wars movies — all in his desperate search for answers to his past.","better graphics and gameplay than the original. star killer still isnt the most compelling protagonist, but he gets the job done. short and sweet, must play if you enjoyed the first game. what a travesty. how far the giants have fallen. in generale, è un gioco migliore del primo. il sistema di combattimento è più responsivo, ha una grafica che per il 2010 era pazzesca e ha un doppiaggio incredibile. però la storia è molto più debole del primo ed il gioco è lungo un terzo rispetto al primo il primo durava circa 10 ore, questo ne dura circa 34, praticamente poteva essere banalmente un dlc del primo anziché essere un gioco a parte. ciononostante il dark side ending è davvero fighissimo e rimpiango leventuale genialata che il gioco poteva avere facendomi continuare la storia come starkiller sith. avgn voice id rather eat a dogs diarrhea anal shit and wash it down with boiled bull piss than ever play this ass of a game ever again. great sequel its overall a disappointing sequel, but still a good kind of ok.",4100.0,18.0,597.0,268.0,3.353561382035259,2.2276119402985075,2010

It is the first entry in the NBA Jam series. The main designer and programmer for this game was Mark Turmell. Midway had previously released such sports games as Arch Rivals in 1989, High Impact in 1990, and Super High Impact in 1991. The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.
              
              The game became exceptionally popular, and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release, creating revenue of $1 billion in quarters. In early 1994, the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.
              
              The release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz), and hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge).","the console ports of this game dont suffer from the coinmunching syndrome that is plagueing the arcade. fun to play especially against another human, otherwise the ai cheats way too much to make it fun for long. i cannot, and will never, condone an arcade game that is asking you for more money even when you win. u will never find a better basketball game maybe nba street but never forget where u came from there was a local restaurant called shillelaghs that had this game as an arcade cabinet when i was a kid. i didnt even like the food really. i would just want to go to play the game. i didnt even like basketball. just that good of a game. had loads of fun with this gem of a basketball game. i always played as the wolf player. que excelente era cuando lo mejor que habia en cuanto a multijugador de a 4 se trataba, era un juego de basquet sin reglas reales y con personajes que podían saltar 10 metros. eramos felices y no lo sabíamos",847.0,0.0,64.0,23.0,3.6435692587685846,2.782608695652174,1993

              This first chapter of Shenmue kicks off Yu Suzuki's cinematic Dreamcast tour-de-force, an exploration-heavy adventure that has players immerse themselves in Yokosuka, Japan. Players slip into the role of a young martial artist named Ryo Hazuki, who is on the trail of his father's killer. On the way, players must talk with hundreds of characters, engage in martial arts battles, and marvel at the realistic depiction of the Japanese coastal town.","shenmue is definitely a game that will never be made again, and i mean that in both a good and a bad way. the amount of attention to detail that this game had in 1999 is unparalleled for its time. it truly is yu suzukis magnum opus as he decided to create a virtual living breathing community of people, and in a lot of ways he succeeded. because of the less traditional approach that was made to create this game, a less traditional mindset needs to be had to really enjoy this kind of game ngl. i think a good modern equivalent would be something like death stranding, a game where if you are able to slow down to the pace that the game asks of you, theres a lot to be had in the sort of atmospheric sense, but if you are going into the game expecting to play it like any other game, focusing on major goals and objectives as skillfully and efficiently as possible, then you are probably gonna be really bored and frustrated at the game. and thats not me trying to say if you have that kind of mindset, you wouldnt understand shenmue, but more me saying this game is not for everyone and you should definitely know that going in if you want to experience this game to its fullest. you gotta play on the games terms, and not really on your own, in that sense. the gameplay just revolves asking people various things to get various hints on where to go next, and once you go to the next place you ask the people in that place where to go, and the cycle continues until you piece together the greater picture of whats going on. my reccomendation is just to give it a shot, and you will probably know within the first few hours whether or not the game is for you. the entire game is a slog, but in the best way possible. played the hd remaster on steam deck for this one. despite being an older game thats definitely showing its age, it still feels so grand  to the point where the ending gave me chills. shenmue is a wild adventure, and im not just talking about what happens ingame. this classic is the quintessential showcase of ambition in the game sphere, as well as how those ambitions eventually ran up against insurmountable limitations. had a deep obsession with this game for a while when i was like 12 genuinely one of the best video games ive ever played, a time capsule of a video game that would later lead to being incredibly influential in ways most probably wouldnt think of in its gameplay and story structure. full of cheesy charm, cozy vibes, great characters and a soapy but fantastic narrative. there is nothing quite like shenmue.",1600.0,61.0,993.0,494.0,3.7308388862423127,2.0101214574898787,1999

The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (""badniks"" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground.
             

              Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection.
             

              The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress.
             

              At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues).
             

              When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a ""Secret Zone"" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a ""goal block"" (which ends the level).","recomendado, pero tener en cuenta que es la 1era entrega. no lo tenian todo atado the one that started it all and what a way to kick things off. a household gem of the sega systems and the source of many childhood memories for me. depois desse jogo..... teve vários outros jogos bons do sonic. divertido e simples, tudo que eu gosto. lixo, jogo desgraçado level design pavoroso dps da green hill zone detestei e foi uma das experiencias que mais me irritou nessa franquia inteira e olha que eu joguei sonic 2006 a masterpiece of design more than it is an actually great game. at the same time, if youre competing with mario, being able to have a style and sound profile that burns itself into a young mind is the only way to gain ground, since its gonna be really hard to make up that distance mechanically.",12000.0,60.0,804.0,243.0,3.2597996318501026,3.308641975308642,1991

The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (""badniks"" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground.
             

              Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection.
             

              The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress.
             

              At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues).
             

              When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a ""Secret Zone"" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a ""goal block"" (which ends the level).","recomendado, pero tener en cuenta que es la 1era entrega. no lo tenian todo atado the one that started it all and what a way to kick things off. a household gem of the sega systems and the source of many childhood memories for me. depois desse jogo..... teve vários outros jogos bons do sonic. divertido e simples, tudo que eu gosto. lixo, jogo desgraçado level design pavoroso dps da green hill zone detestei e foi uma das experiencias que mais me irritou nessa franquia inteira e olha que eu joguei sonic 2006 a masterpiece of design more than it is an actually great game. at the same time, if youre competing with mario, being able to have a style and sound profile that burns itself into a young mind is the only way to gain ground, since its gonna be really hard to make up that distance mechanically.",12000.0,60.0,804.0,243.0,3.2597996318501026,3.308641975308642,1991

It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989.
             

              The Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards.
             

              The game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010). A remastered, high-definition, version of The Sands of Time was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on November 16, 2010.","prince of persia the sands of time is without question one of the most influential platformers ever made. its easy to trace its legacy during play. moments where ledges fall away, revealing a specific path for the prince to climb on, or removing pieces of scaffolding that the player balances on have been redone again and again and again. uncharted , god of war , tomb raider , jedi fallen order , and many more all follow in the example that this game set, if in an extremely diluted way. so, does this original version stand up to the test of time i would say it does fairly well. gamecube was such a good era this game is considered a classic and it deserves to be. it does go on a little longer than id like, and the combat is a little barebones, but thats about it. i was one of the idiots that played this game on steam. its an awful windows game, as it is heavily bugged and requires a lot of time and effort to make it playable. however, i gave it another go since i acquired the steam deck. playing this game through proton actually fixes a lot of the issues with playing the game on a modern windows system. you would still have to do a couple of things to get it working as if it was native to the system, but the amount of effort required is much less on the steam deck than a modern windows machine. esses jogos sao mto subestimados polished yet monotonous. after the initial exposition youre left going from platforming to combat for hours without a single drop of narrative. progressing through the game is fun though, so if you dont pay much attention to story either way have a blast. id argue this game couldve been inspiration for the uncharted series as theres plenty of parallels.",5500.0,37.0,1100.0,421.0,3.6259721715337565,2.6128266033254155,2003

Dracula's castle is a single continuous building, and as Nathan discovers artifacts within it he gains new abilities that allow him to explore more of it. While Nathan can only use his Killer Whip as a weapon, he can find and equip different kinds of armor and accessories that change his stats. Unique to this entry in the series is the Dual Set-up System, where a combination of two cards will give Nathan unique magical abilities. For example, equipping a fire type card with a whip card will give the Killer Whip a fire attribute, while equipping it with a summon card will let Nathan summon a fire demon to attack onscreen enemies.","fede some of yall just haters this shit aint even that bad the final boss is hard nyuk nyuk nyuk pro tip take advantage of the gimmick of the game, there is literally a card set that makes the final boss a cake walk. yall tripping. i was gonna be a little more generous with this game but after attempting the final boss and fucking up through all the tedium of trying to hit a floating eyeball probably at least 50 successive times without getting hit more than 4 times i just gave up. having played sotn before this game this one is just a significant step down. weird map design in certain areas, a lot bosses that have one bullshit random attack that you most likely will not be able to dodge and will end up killing you hundreds of times until youre lucky enough to win. the game at least felt pretty good to play and had some good music, and the card system is fun in concept, but by the time i got to the end of the game i dont think i even managed to pick up half the cards and theres no way in hell im grinding for them. i guess i was also underleveled at the end of the game but again theres no way in hell i will grind in a game like this a fun continuation of what symphony of the night did, but a little bit more scaled down to be on a portable. exploring draculas castle is as fun as always, the music kicks ass, and the powerups you find for defeating bosses are always fun to use. however, i didnt really like the way items were handled in this game. drop rates are incredibly low, and there is no shop so duplicate pieces of equipment become pointless. there are also these cards that you can combine to give yourself various effects, and those cards are also locked behind random enemy drops. i would have liked it more if the cards were something you naturally found around the map rather than something that you have to grind for. the last bit of the game becomes a bit of a slog, with the second to last boss being in a particularly annoying to reach area and the final boss being really cheaply designed imo. despite that, i still had a lot of fun with a majority of the time in this game, so its def worth trying if you like metroidvanias. more like circling back to the entrance of the room because you found another hallway that just leads to a dead end and a potion the map design in this one is actually fuckin tight. too bad youll spend the entire game double tapping the controller to dash at the weirdest fucking speed. the jump feels like homie is on the moon its so wack. the soul system or whatever is cool in theory but its so so so ass backwards. story blows. really not a fan of this one",2100.0,62.0,742.0,272.0,3.3609532559904194,2.7279411764705883,2001

first rpg that introduced me to the genre, it holds a special nostalgic place in my heart. funny enough, ive played more jrpgs after playing this one that going back to it, it feels rather odd in comparison. still though, i love the game and i hold fondly of the time i have spent on it as a middle schooler. wish it performed better financially there are some movies and tv shows that im convinced only really hit if you watch them at a certain age. it is my firm belief that if you havent watched star trek, mean girls, or the breakfast club before the age of 18, you will never understand or enjoy these things at least, i did not. similarly, i think some games are appreciated more if they come at a certain time in your life. kingdoms of amalur reckoning is one of those games. this game would have been really cool if i had played it when i was 1012 it was not out in the mid00s, and there was no way the graphic violence would have gotten past my moms onewoman censorship board. it would probably be pretty cool if i was in college and played it while listening to lectures or something. however, as a grown man, this game feels very basic and boring. first offender is the combat. the combat is in real time, and feels close to dragons dogma or scarlet nexus, if you are familiar with those games. the combat in amalur has the twin drawbacks of being barebones and stiff. there is only one basic attack no lightheavy attacks or parries, a dodge that feels awkward to use, a range attack that quickly runs out of ammo and seems quite pointless, and a set of spells that can be customized. the spells are kind of cool, but they, cant really be chained into combos,. there is also a super saiyan mode that can be built up by filling up your ragedevil triggerswhatever instead of making you superpowered for a small amount of time like dmc or giving you access to a massive attack that can curbstomp multiple enemies at once like blades of time, it gives you the change to attack one enemy with a super special attack that gives you extra exp. combat in this game has no depth and feels like a repetitive chore the lack of a parry, a decent dodge, or any combos beyond your basic tap x sequence is keenly felt. the swift, exciting, and somewhat openended combat of devil may cry has spoiled me, i suppose. it is true that there are some combos that you can unlock in the game, but i didnt find the ones that i unlocked useful. additionally, you also have to use perk points to unlock them only for specific weapons. realize that the hammer sucks and want to use a greatsword too bad, youve put all of your points into the hammer. it is true that you can respec later on, but this kind of game would have benefitted from a skyrimstyle system where you level up weapons ability based on using the weapon. the story is your usual highfantasy bafflegarble its not great, but im usually fairly lenient on bad stories as long as they arent shoved in your face by cinematic cutscenes. the dialogue choices tend to be pointless and apparently you can use persuasion skills to steamroll past everything. i highly dislike dialogue choices in games where they do not make a difference or make very little difference developers and writers need to have confidence in the story that they are telling. the open world is a series of poorlydisguised corridors with the occasional boring dungeon. the game feels less open than an n64 zelda, and even the map clearly shows the corridors. thus, theres no real exploration in the game not that there is any real point to the exploration anyway. i found nothing about the enemy designs, world, or other art to be at all interesting. the semicartoony art style clashed with the occasional graphic violence of the game. every npc has a thousand dialogue keywords that you can choose from, and none of them are interesting. the loot system was not engaging or addicting there was no way to easily compare stats for new items vs equipped items, and given the fact that combat felt like a chore, i didnt really feel excited to upgrade my gear. i am barely interested in smithing, crafting, alchemy etc. in most games, and in any case skyrim did all of these better than amalur. everything about this game just felt like busywork. i could probably forgive one or more mediocre elements of this game if they combined to create an immersive and interesting whole, but amalur just feels like fantasy game the game. everything in the game feels very much like a video game element. i dont know if this makes sense, but it describes the sense i felt while playing it. it was the opposite of skyrim, a game that, while it contains clunky and repetitive elements, really feels like living in a fantasy world. amalur feels like playing a fantasy game quite appropriately, since it was originally intended to be an mmo and nothing about it grabbed me. in my earlier years i may have been able to ignore its many flaws, but at this point in my life, with so much experience gaming and so many superior choices available, i cant justify playing this game. na verga tis a beauty of a game. i was really satisfied with this,

Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to “roll up” items increasing the Katamari’s size until it’s suitable for the King.
             

              Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items.
             

              Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari’s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions.

The nature of the series remains generally lighthearted, something that's reinforced by its playful, anime-inspired visual style, but the nature of the crimes committed can be cold and downright disturbing.

Interactive Entertainment, which takes place in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Legendarium.
             

              The game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life.
             

              The game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor.
             

              The melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm, using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player's combo multiplier.
             

              A unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory. These enemies will continue to do their own jobs and tasks even when they're off screen. If the player does not kill an enemy in an encounter, this enemy will remember the player and change their tactics and conversations based on the encounter.","it has combat from arkham and assassins creed, climbing from uncharted, stealth from every 7th gen third person game, you spend half of the time clearing out bandit camps, and you play the most ai generated character in all of gaming. im sure we all remember that iconic lord of the rings characters name. this is a game so derivative of every other game around it that it lacks any identity and purpose to exist. monolith is an underrated company. fear was an underrated franchise in general, although the 3rd kind of fell flat. luckily they managed to claim some of the respect they were due with this game. a jogabilidade é muito boa o jogo tem um sistema de combate bem dinâmico, com muitos movimentos e habilidades que você pode aprender ao longo do jogo. além disso, o jogo tem o sistema nêmesis, onde os inimigos que você enfrenta vão se lembrar de você e evoluir de acordo com suas ações e para mim é o ponto alto do jogo. honestly not even that good of a game but i had a blast with the nemesis system and i enjoyed doing mindless treasure huntingrepetitive missions just because i liked making uruks feel as much pain as possible. would recommend to family and friends. its assassins creed in middle earth. whats not to love the nemesis system is still, to this day, one of the coolest things ive ever seen in a video game and its a shame that wb has done nothing with it since. disclaimer these are my brief thoughts based on my memory of playing this 8 years ago manswine",8400.0,106.0,1700.0,478.0,3.516752815299235,3.5564853556485354,2014

talking about. and though i do have some praises for it.... yeah, this aint good. its not a long game, either, it took me about 9 hours to complete it. i like axl, i really like the idea of him being more of a bad boy type at the beginning, while he slowly shows that he is actually pretty good. its quite a shame that, on the english version, they gave him the most annoying voice possible well, to be frank that goes to the hyena boss. his voice in japan is minami takayama, mostly known for voicing envy in fma and hajime hinata in danganronpa, and she fits the character perfectly. and i do like the idea of a rogue company besically taking the mantle of hunting mavericks as the hunters are still on the process of rebuilding themselves, and x is going through.... a weird justification to not fighting which im sure its because x is so broken gameplaywise that hed make the game as easy as possible, so they have to hold him out for as long as possible. as for the gameplay... uh. yeah, this is bad. theres no way around it. the camera angles are bad, zero is just bad in general, x is too op, and axl.... is fine, actually. it really feels like they were making this game specifically for axl, considering the enemy placements and how they behave. heck, axl plays so fine he has a dodge roll. truly a dark souls moment. still, the absolute dread of saving the reploids when most of them are in the worst possible spot, and having to deal with enemies that just have too much hp.... its like mmx5, but miles worse. and as much as i praise the plot.... they still have to have sigma as the villain, which just feels again, like an afterthought. overall, i dislike the game, though i do have some respect for the story and for what they were trying to do with the gameplay. shame it didnt work out at all. games got a good soundtrack, and tbh, thats all i can say it does well at. practically everything else is borked for one reason or another, and its a shame that this was the one and only time the series ever attempted to go 3d. mega man x7 is the worst most dogshit fucking game i have played how do you go from the bad x6 to the abomination that is x7, i wanna say x6 and x7 are two sides of the same coin with x6 being a really bad difficult game while x7 is a really bad easy game and besides x7s others problems when it comes to just that i would take x6 from a mile away. dont get me wrong i adore easy games kirby is one of if not my favorite nintendo franchise, but the thing is that kirby even at its worst can be kind of fun meanwhile this game i just did not have fun specially with its atrocious level designs with every single stage feeling like a weird gimmick the way they handled 3d was horrible, i know the way they couldnt handle the shooting with how its in the 3d like doing something like the zelda n64 duology with z targeting, but with this game it makes it just ridiculously easy all of mm is about directing your shots and while i have not tried the legends games from the little gameplay ive seen i feel like they did 3d mega man right, and that was years before x7. one way they could have done shooting was like ratchet  clank just having some sort of crosshair, the thing is the way they made 3d just does not work at all they made the camera look up instead of behind the player yk like how a fucking 3d game that works, and the thing is the 2d doesnt even fucking work in this game with enemies still acting in a 3d environment it makes it a pain in the ass dealing with enemies that the lockon barely works with enemies that are in the background or foreground its so fucking bad and makes me realize that x7 has the most bland level design when it comes to 2d legit the last stages are almost as difficult as the opening stages from x16 its really dumb and ridiculously easy for it, honestly i could go on with the story, character misinterpretation or newcomers i fucking hate axl, but im just tired of talking about this game this is the most dogshit game i have played and if you want to be like me and play every x game please just skip this game if you want to play the mega man x games because they are something i really adore

The approach is more typical of traditional survival horror games, although some role-playing elements are retained.","cops are dumb af lmao for me, the parasite eve games have been very average. they are fununtil theyre not, basically. i think part of the problem is that they havent aged very well. i think pe1 and 2 are good games. but i definitely let the fact that they have a bit of an re aesthetic and it being an rpg which is pretty cool convince me the games are better then they actually. overall nothing special once you properly analyze the games. nada mal, me gusto su mecanica rpg en tiempo real y su historia sobre las mitocondrias pero bastante frustante el moviento del pj a la hora tanto de moverse y en el combate. recomiendo jugarlo cuando tengas ganas de jugar algun juego retro de la famosa ps1. while i still found this game to be enjoyable, it doesnt hold a candle to the original game. unfortunately, it lost a bit of its soul in trying to become more like resident evil, than a true successor to its predecessor. esta muy guapo el juego, pero el mayor problema que tengo con el es que es super facil cagarla para no sacar el final bueno del juego y eso me parece un mierdon increible, pero bueno, por todo lo demas bastante bien",763.0,16.0,657.0,344.0,3.567778119763346,1.9098837209302326,1999

Interactive Entertainment, which takes place in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Legendarium.
             

              The game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life.
             

              The game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor.
             

              The melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm, using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player's combo multiplier.
             

              A unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory. These enemies will continue to do their own jobs and tasks even when they're off screen. If the player does not kill an enemy in an encounter, this enemy will remember the player and change their tactics and conversations based on the encounter.","it has combat from arkham and assassins creed, climbing from uncharted, stealth from every 7th gen third person game, you spend half of the time clearing out bandit camps, and you play the most ai generated character in all of gaming. im sure we all remember that iconic lord of the rings characters name. this is a game so derivative of every other game around it that it lacks any identity and purpose to exist. monolith is an underrated company. fear was an underrated franchise in general, although the 3rd kind of fell flat. luckily they managed to claim some of the respect they were due with this game. a jogabilidade é muito boa o jogo tem um sistema de combate bem dinâmico, com muitos movimentos e habilidades que você pode aprender ao longo do jogo. além disso, o jogo tem o sistema nêmesis, onde os inimigos que você enfrenta vão se lembrar de você e evoluir de acordo com suas ações e para mim é o ponto alto do jogo. honestly not even that good of a game but i had a blast with the nemesis system and i enjoyed doing mindless treasure huntingrepetitive missions just because i liked making uruks feel as much pain as possible. would recommend to family and friends. its assassins creed in middle earth. whats not to love the nemesis system is still, to this day, one of the coolest things ive ever seen in a video game and its a shame that wb has done nothing with it since. disclaimer these are my brief thoughts based on my memory of playing this 8 years ago manswine",8400.0,106.0,1700.0,478.0,3.516752815299235,3.5564853556485354,2014

The game tells the story of a futuristic confederation protected by an elite band of mercenaries: Dead Echo. When Dead Echo members Grayson Hunt and Ishi Sato learn they've been working for the wrong side, they're betrayed by their commander and exiled to the far reaches of the galaxy. In Bulletstorm, Grayson and Ishi find themselves surrounded by hordes of mutants and flesh eating gangs in an abandoned paradise.

Bulletstorm's array of distinct 'skillshots' produces unprecedented levels of frantic gameplay and yell-inducing satisfaction.

The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.

              The release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz), and hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge).","the console ports of this game dont suffer from the coinmunching syndrome that is plagueing the arcade. fun to play especially against another human, otherwise the ai cheats way too much to make it fun for long. i cannot, and will never, condone an arcade game that is asking you for more money even when you win. u will never find a better basketball game maybe nba street but never forget where u came from there was a local restaurant called shillelaghs that had this game as an arcade cabinet when i was a kid. i didnt even like the food really. i would just want to go to play the game. i didnt even like basketball. just that good of a game. had loads of fun with this gem of a basketball game. i always played as the wolf player. que excelente era cuando lo mejor que habia en cuanto a multijugador de a 4 se trataba, era un juego de basquet sin reglas reales y con personajes que podían saltar 10 metros. eramos felices y no lo sabíamos",847.0,0.0,64.0,23.0,3.6435692587685846,2.782608695652174,1993

Interactive Entertainment, which takes place in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Legendarium.
             

              The game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life.
             

              The game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor.
             

              The melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm, using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player's combo multiplier.
             

              A unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory. These enemies will continue to do their own jobs and tasks even when they're off screen. If the player does not kill an enemy in an encounter, this enemy will remember the player and change their tactics and conversations based on the encounter.","it has combat from arkham and assassins creed, climbing from uncharted, stealth from every 7th gen third person game, you spend half of the time clearing out bandit camps, and you play the most ai generated character in all of gaming. im sure we all remember that iconic lord of the rings characters name. this is a game so derivative of every other game around it that it lacks any identity and purpose to exist. monolith is an underrated company. fear was an underrated franchise in general, although the 3rd kind of fell flat. luckily they managed to claim some of the respect they were due with this game. a jogabilidade é muito boa o jogo tem um sistema de combate bem dinâmico, com muitos movimentos e habilidades que você pode aprender ao longo do jogo. além disso, o jogo tem o sistema nêmesis, onde os inimigos que você enfrenta vão se lembrar de você e evoluir de acordo com suas ações e para mim é o ponto alto do jogo. honestly not even that good of a game but i had a blast with the nemesis system and i enjoyed doing mindless treasure huntingrepetitive missions just because i liked making uruks feel as much pain as possible. would recommend to family and friends. its assassins creed in middle earth. whats not to love the nemesis system is still, to this day, one of the coolest things ive ever seen in a video game and its a shame that wb has done nothing with it since. disclaimer these are my brief thoughts based on my memory of playing this 8 years ago manswine",8400.0,106.0,1700.0,478.0,3.516752815299235,3.5564853556485354,2014

It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989.
             

              The Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards.
             

              The game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010). A remastered, high-definition, version of The Sands of Time was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on November 16, 2010.","prince of persia the sands of time is without question one of the most influential platformers ever made. its easy to trace its legacy during play. moments where ledges fall away, revealing a specific path for the prince to climb on, or removing pieces of scaffolding that the player balances on have been redone again and again and again. uncharted , god of war , tomb raider , jedi fallen order , and many more all follow in the example that this game set, if in an extremely diluted way. so, does this original version stand up to the test of time i would say it does fairly well. gamecube was such a good era this game is considered a classic and it deserves to be. it does go on a little longer than id like, and the combat is a little barebones, but thats about it. i was one of the idiots that played this game on steam. its an awful windows game, as it is heavily bugged and requires a lot of time and effort to make it playable. however, i gave it another go since i acquired the steam deck. playing this game through proton actually fixes a lot of the issues with playing the game on a modern windows system. you would still have to do a couple of things to get it working as if it was native to the system, but the amount of effort required is much less on the steam deck than a modern windows machine. esses jogos sao mto subestimados polished yet monotonous. after the initial exposition youre left going from platforming to combat for hours without a single drop of narrative. progressing through the game is fun though, so if you dont pay much attention to story either way have a blast. id argue this game couldve been inspiration for the uncharted series as theres plenty of parallels.",5500.0,37.0,1100.0,421.0,3.6259721715337565,2.6128266033254155,2003

A. Salvatore. Brought to life visually through the trademark visceral style of renowned artist and Spawn creator Todd McFarlane, Reckoning brings a new level of intense action combat to the RPG genre.","as the first rpg that introduced me to the genre, it holds a special nostalgic place in my heart. funny enough, ive played more jrpgs after playing this one that going back to it, it feels rather odd in comparison. still though, i love the game and i hold fondly of the time i have spent on it as a middle schooler. wish it performed better financially there are some movies and tv shows that im convinced only really hit if you watch them at a certain age. it is my firm belief that if you havent watched star trek, mean girls, or the breakfast club before the age of 18, you will never understand or enjoy these things at least, i did not. similarly, i think some games are appreciated more if they come at a certain time in your life. kingdoms of amalur reckoning is one of those games. this game would have been really cool if i had played it when i was 1012 it was not out in the mid00s, and there was no way the graphic violence would have gotten past my moms onewoman censorship board. it would probably be pretty cool if i was in college and played it while listening to lectures or something. however, as a grown man, this game feels very basic and boring. first offender is the combat. the combat is in real time, and feels close to dragons dogma or scarlet nexus, if you are familiar with those games. the combat in amalur has the twin drawbacks of being barebones and stiff. there is only one basic attack no lightheavy attacks or parries, a dodge that feels awkward to use, a range attack that quickly runs out of ammo and seems quite pointless, and a set of spells that can be customized. the spells are kind of cool, but they, cant really be chained into combos,. there is also a super saiyan mode that can be built up by filling up your ragedevil triggerswhatever instead of making you superpowered for a small amount of time like dmc or giving you access to a massive attack that can curbstomp multiple enemies at once like blades of time, it gives you the change to attack one enemy with a super special attack that gives you extra exp. combat in this game has no depth and feels like a repetitive chore the lack of a parry, a decent dodge, or any combos beyond your basic tap x sequence is keenly felt. the swift, exciting, and somewhat openended combat of devil may cry has spoiled me, i suppose. it is true that there are some combos that you can unlock in the game, but i didnt find the ones that i unlocked useful. additionally, you also have to use perk points to unlock them only for specific weapons. realize that the hammer sucks and want to use a greatsword too bad, youve put all of your points into the hammer. it is true that you can respec later on, but this kind of game would have benefitted from a skyrimstyle system where you level up weapons ability based on using the weapon. the story is your usual highfantasy bafflegarble its not great, but im usually fairly lenient on bad stories as long as they arent shoved in your face by cinematic cutscenes. the dialogue choices tend to be pointless and apparently you can use persuasion skills to steamroll past everything. i highly dislike dialogue choices in games where they do not make a difference or make very little difference developers and writers need to have confidence in the story that they are telling. the open world is a series of poorlydisguised corridors with the occasional boring dungeon. the game feels less open than an n64 zelda, and even the map clearly shows the corridors. thus, theres no real exploration in the game not that there is any real point to the exploration anyway. i found nothing about the enemy designs, world, or other art to be at all interesting. the semicartoony art style clashed with the occasional graphic violence of the game. every npc has a thousand dialogue keywords that you can choose from, and none of them are interesting. the loot system was not engaging or addicting there was no way to easily compare stats for new items vs equipped items, and given the fact that combat felt like a chore, i didnt really feel excited to upgrade my gear. i am barely interested in smithing, crafting, alchemy etc. in most games, and in any case skyrim did all of these better than amalur. everything about this game just felt like busywork. i could probably forgive one or more mediocre elements of this game if they combined to create an immersive and interesting whole, but amalur just feels like fantasy game the game. everything in the game feels very much like a video game element. i dont know if this makes sense, but it describes the sense i felt while playing it. it was the opposite of skyrim, a game that, while it contains clunky and repetitive elements, really feels like living in a fantasy world. amalur feels like playing a fantasy game quite appropriately, since it was originally intended to be an mmo and nothing about it grabbed me. in my earlier years i may have been able to ignore its many flaws, but at this point in my life, with so much experience gaming and so many superior choices available, i cant justify playing this game. na verga tis a beauty of a game. i was really satisfied with this, especially considering it came out only a few months after the extremely greybrown skyrim. its basically just skyrim with a much more interesting world and a much deeper combat system. it honestly felt kind of similar to the original god of war games in that way. for a game that got overshadowed by bigger titles its incredibly underrated and deserves more recognition. its a beautiful looking game with so much to explore and do, i loved it for the first 34 of the game. however...when it gets towards the end you find its very half assed, theres a few bugs here and there and it just felt very incomplete. but most of the game is great and there is so much character creation its ridiculous, dlcs were interesting and beautiful looking pieces two. action rpg

              Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 takes place between Chapters 5 and 6 of the previous game, Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu. Several characters from Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu appear, such as Leaf, Fin, and Nanna. It takes place in the Thracian peninsula in southeastern Jugdral.","theres genuinely nothing funny i could say about thracia, or anything that hasnt already been said about it that would do it justice. theres no other fe game that matches its raw gameplay integrity and absolutely genius ideas, with genealogy at least coming in close second. for every bullshit thing the game throws at you, the game gives you quadruple the amount of bullshit to use against the enemy  like there are so many brave and master weapons and staves that basically get handed to you on a silver platter, and while there are a few chapters that are trial and error, actually figuring them out genuinely feels so good  no other fire emblem game gives me this much dopamine. hell, i made a long ass text file documenting my experiences with the game, going in depth on every strategy i utilised in every chapter and giving pointers and advice that either myself or someone else could use whenever they decide to play. i think its worth mentioning that this is the first time a game has compelled me to do something like this. amei as mecânicas do jogo espero que apareça em outros jogos ou algum futuro remake me diverti bem mais com esse comparado com o fe4 envelheceu bem demais e algum dia vou revisitar mesmo com toda raiva que passei em alguns mapas im never touching this game for the rest of my life. i have never felt such hatred inside of me until i played this game. the story and characters really carry this game. take me back to genealogy please. also, fuck the ballistae in this game. its the kind of game that will kick in the stomach, laugh and continue to kick you, until its get tired, but when it does, it will extend you a hand and treat you like a hero. play it if you have some experience with tactical games otherwise you will have a bad time. oh my god. i cant believe i slept on this game kept it for last thinking it would be too hard for me. despite being on the snes, its an absolute masterpiece of a game, which can be attributed to the fact it tests the snes to its limits, being the final snes game ever made, released in 1999, nine years after the sness inception, and 3 years into the n64s lifespan. shouzou kaga was evidently opposed to making a fire emblem game on the n64, believing the 3d graphics would hurt the appearance of his characters, and that philosophy to keep the characters 2d carried over to the ps1s tear ring saga yutona heroes war chronicles. that too went well, but lets focus on fe5. this game probably took about 10 years from my lifespan but i still loved it, the infamous difficulty of the game is actually really satisfying and well balanced especially in the first half, but after chapter 18 or so is.... painful, to say the least. still, after strategizing for hours, constantly saving and loading states and rage moments,sense of accomplishment i get from beating a stage from a 24 year old srpg is remarkable probably my favorite aspect about fe5 is the overall tone of it. while fe4 had its fair share of dark moments, this game is straight up depressing, you actually feel how bleak and despair the situation is in every chapter. by the beggining of the game, you feel completely lost,and confused by the mechanics and the difficulty, just like leif, feeling lost on this brutal war. you are not a group of experienced and heroic knights, leading for victory, you are mostly common folk going against a full fledged empire, and youre obviously going to get obliterated against such force. but as you learn the mechanics of the game and gain strong units, a hope slowly rises, and you go from how the hell am i going to survive from this to hey, i can actually do this and you start to command larger armies on bigger maps. and then, you are facing with the strongest forces of the empire. its actually even harder then before, but you have so much more experince with the game,you dont feel as powerless as before. and after youve gone through so much, beating the game and seeing those credits rolled is one of the most rewarding feelings a game can give to you this, is phenomenal storytelling, and you can only have this in a videogame, that unforgiving difficulty is one of the finest examples of storytelling through gameplay. thats why remake of this game is probably going to suck, since theyll inevatiabely tone down the difficulty. gameplay has a surprising amount of resource management, and i love this, you can capture enemies to steal their equipment,but its significantly harder and risky to do,since youll deal much less and take much more damage. but since you dont get much chance to buy and repair weapons, you really have to pay attention the resources you have, and use them in the most efficient way to overcome challenges you face fatigue is also a new mechanic, which if you use a unit too much, you wont be able to use them in the next chapter, which makes powerful units more tricky to use, adding another depth to the gameplay. youll only want to use them when necessary, so you actually have a reason to use less powerful units, i gotta say this was hard to get used to, especially after i obliterated every enemy with ayra and larcei in fe4, but it didnt took long to for me to actually like it also fantastic map designs suplements the complex gameplay mechanics brilliantly. fe5 abandons the massive maps of fe4 in favor of smaller, but focused maps with multiple objectives, and while some enemy placements made me want to torn apart my bone structure from my skinthose goddamn ballistas will give me nightmares for the most part i really apprecieted the variety in both the map design and objectives. you have defense, escape, fog of warwhich isnt that bad in my opinion and of course normal seize missions. also each map has its own unique objective, which makes every single map even more memorable. varied objectives makes each chapter fresh, which is something ive never seen in an srpg weakest part of this game imo are the characters, in fe4, you have a lot of optional conversations between characters, and those conversations actually give a decent personality and development to each unit, in fe5, most of the cast has 5 lines of dialogues at most, and all of them are in the chapter you recruit them. but i really like how the game tells what happened to them after the credits rolled though this doesnt mean that this game has no good character writing, far from it, leif is one the best written main characters ive ever seen in a game. like i mentioned before, you start of the game as powerless, and with zero knowledge on the complex mechanics of the game. just like leif, whos a 15 year old who has never commanded an army. this is obviously no coincidence, leif represents the player, but unlike most games that have a main character which isrepresenting the playerleif isnt a silent protagonist, his development from an inexperienced kid to a mature war commander is very natural, and paralells brilliantly with the development of you as a player, as you understand how the game works and start using the tools you have in the most optimal ways. leif alone is enough to say this game has fantastic character writing im not sure if fire emblem 5 is better than 4,but still, this is one the finest srpgs ever made. its frusturating for sure, but its so well designed in nearly every aspect, its impossible for me to hate it. id highly recommend it if you liked fe4, and simply want to see more from this world.",820.0,65.0,771.0,329.0,3.843290620439043,2.3434650455927053,1999

Living poor and dying young, the lower class unite in protest as a new kind of family, gangs, who turn to a life in the underworld in their struggle to survive.

It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989.
             

              The Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards.
             

              The game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010). A remastered, high-definition, version of The Sands of Time was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on November 16, 2010.","prince of persia the sands of time is without question one of the most influential platformers ever made. its easy to trace its legacy during play. moments where ledges fall away, revealing a specific path for the prince to climb on, or removing pieces of scaffolding that the player balances on have been redone again and again and again. uncharted , god of war , tomb raider , jedi fallen order , and many more all follow in the example that this game set, if in an extremely diluted way. so, does this original version stand up to the test of time i would say it does fairly well. gamecube was such a good era this game is considered a classic and it deserves to be. it does go on a little longer than id like, and the combat is a little barebones, but thats about it. i was one of the idiots that played this game on steam. its an awful windows game, as it is heavily bugged and requires a lot of time and effort to make it playable. however, i gave it another go since i acquired the steam deck. playing this game through proton actually fixes a lot of the issues with playing the game on a modern windows system. you would still have to do a couple of things to get it working as if it was native to the system, but the amount of effort required is much less on the steam deck than a modern windows machine. esses jogos sao mto subestimados polished yet monotonous. after the initial exposition youre left going from platforming to combat for hours without a single drop of narrative. progressing through the game is fun though, so if you dont pay much attention to story either way have a blast. id argue this game couldve been inspiration for the uncharted series as theres plenty of parallels.",5500.0,37.0,1100.0,421.0,3.6259721715337565,2.6128266033254155,2003

It is the first entry in the NBA Jam series. The main designer and programmer for this game was Mark Turmell. Midway had previously released such sports games as Arch Rivals in 1989, High Impact in 1990, and Super High Impact in 1991. The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.
              
              The game became exceptionally popular, and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release, creating revenue of $1 billion in quarters. In early 1994, the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.
              
              The release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz), and hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge).","the console ports of this game dont suffer from the coinmunching syndrome that is plagueing the arcade. fun to play especially against another human, otherwise the ai cheats way too much to make it fun for long. i cannot, and will never, condone an arcade game that is asking you for more money even when you win. u will never find a better basketball game maybe nba street but never forget where u came from there was a local restaurant called shillelaghs that had this game as an arcade cabinet when i was a kid. i didnt even like the food really. i would just want to go to play the game. i didnt even like basketball. just that good of a game. had loads of fun with this gem of a basketball game. i always played as the wolf player. que excelente era cuando lo mejor que habia en cuanto a multijugador de a 4 se trataba, era un juego de basquet sin reglas reales y con personajes que podían saltar 10 metros. eramos felices y no lo sabíamos",847.0,0.0,64.0,23.0,3.6435692587685846,2.782608695652174,1993

Most of the gameplay mechanics introduced in Ground Zeroes are carried over: it is still an action game and stealth oriented but replaces the linear corridor design from most earlier titles with large open world environments that offer the player unrestricted freedom for the approach. The world has now a real-time day and night cycle and various weather effects that influence enemy behaviour, visibility and sound. Sabotaging or destroying certain structures can also influence other parts of the map.","kojima i love you please have my children story will leave you with actual phantom pain but the gameplay is unmatched in the action stealth genre. preparing for missions and utilizing all the unique gear are the best parts of mgsv. the game does nothing to justify its open world structure though and adds unnecessary grinding for materials to upgrade your base which bogs down the gameplay. its hard to review this game. it has the best gameplay in the series, easily, but thats constantly interrupted by helicopter rides, visits to mother base, selecting your loadouts even though, for me, it was the same loadout for almost every mission and micromanaging your many recruits. still, while youre actually in the field, the stealth gameplay feels excellent. but then it has the absolute worst story in the series. on the plus side... kinda... the vast majority of the story is on cassette tapes that are completely optional. only 1015 hours into this game and already its one of my favorites of all time. let me illustrate why via some comparisons. average call of duty mission walk in a straight line. kill some people. average f.e.a.r. mission walk in a straight line until you reach an arena where you will move around strategically and kill some people. average far cry 34 mission drive across the world until you reach the location. hide on a hill and snipe every bad guy at the base, then walk inside. or sneak inside, i dont care. this funnels you into a segment where you walk forward and kill people. average msgv mission you have 15 minutes to destroy enemy vehicles. their path is marked on your pip boy. call in a supply drop for a grenade launcher up ahead, then ride on your horse to get ahead of a tank, pick up the grenade launcher, and ambush the tank. next, ride across a bridge to the other side of a river, plant some c4, set up an ammo drop, go prone, and wait for another vehicle to pass by so you can blow it up. next, you get a message that a jeep is transporting a prisoner you need to extract. its across the river. user your sniper rifle to kill the driver and guard, run across the river, extract the prisoner, park the jeep in the middle of the road so that it stops the next vehicle that is coming your way. find a place to hide so you can ambush the vehicle. this is just the first half of the mission. and if you die, you can approach it a completely different way. this game feels like it takes far cry 4 and turns every gameplay element except for the open world up to 11. instead of just shutting down the radios at a base, you can destroy their comms equipment, their antiair radar, and their electrical power. dont just shut off the lightsshut off the lights, plant c4 on the power source, and then blow up the guy who comes by to turn the lights on. but be careful, because the enemies will react to anything you do. keep turning the lights off and they will start wearing nightvision goggles. the amount of things you can do in this game is amazing. even though the game is relatively difficult for me, anyway, it always feels fair. its always clear what killed me, and successfully completing a mission is less a matter of just getting better at doing a specific thing and more a matter of changing tactics. enemy behavior is some of the most realistic and immersive ive seen in a stealth game. sure, you can cheese the ai, but you really have to work for it, instead of just going round the corner so the enemies forget your presence. it really does feel like living through an awesome action movie rather than playing a video game. i only have a few complaints. one is that the open world really is empty theres nothing besides enemy bases. i wouldnt so much call this an open world game as an open arena game or a semisandbox game or something equally clunky. the goal of the open world in this game is not so much to simulate a living, breathing world like skyrim or far cry 4, but to give you a large area of operations for your missions. it succeeds in that regard, but i do wish there had been some more dynamic events happening. my other complaint is with the base management portion of the gameit feels like a mobile game, and takes away from the action. i want to be sneaking around and shooting stuff, not clicking through a menu. these are small complaints, however, and i can safely say that this game is one of the best games i have ever played. since the game regularly goes on sale for a steep discount, i heartily recommend buying it. one more thing you can put your own music into the game to play through your pokedex or on the helicopter. theres nothing quite as iconic as blasting through a base while back in black blares through the stereo, or having your chopper play born in the usa every time it picks you up. release the kojimas cut",14000.0,503.0,4500.0,1200.0,3.766521187482147,3.75,2015

              Set in the immediate aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, L4D's survival co-op mode lets you blast a path through the infected in four unique “movies,” guiding your survivors across the rooftops of an abandoned metropolis, through rural ghost towns and pitch-black forests in your quest to escape a devastated Ground Zero crawling with infected enemies. Each ""movie"" is comprised of five large maps, and can be played by one to four human players, with an emphasis on team-based strategy and objectives.
             

              New technology dubbed ""the AI Director"" is used to generate a unique gameplay experience every time you play. The Director tailors the frequency and ferocity of the zombie attacks to your performance, putting you in the middle of a fast-paced, but not overwhelming, Hollywood horror movie.
