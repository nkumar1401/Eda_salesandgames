It is the sequel to Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes released the year before and a prequel to the original Metal Gear. The game has a complex story with long cut-scene sequences, but there are fewer and they are shorter compared to earlier Metal Gear Solid titles. Most of the gameplay mechanics introduced in Ground Zeroes are carried over: it is still an action game and stealth oriented but replaces the linear corridor design from most earlier titles with large open world environments that offer the player unrestricted freedom for the approach. The world has now a real-time day and night cycle and various weather effects that influence enemy behaviour, visibility and sound. Sabotaging or destroying certain structures can also influence other parts of the map.","kojima i love you please have my children story will leave you with actual phantom pain but the gameplay is unmatched in the action stealth genre. preparing for missions and utilizing all the unique gear are the best parts of mgsv. the game does nothing to justify its open world structure though and adds unnecessary grinding for materials to upgrade your base which bogs down the gameplay. its hard to review this game. it has the best gameplay in the series, easily, but thats constantly interrupted by helicopter rides, visits to mother base, selecting your loadouts even though, for me, it was the same loadout for almost every mission and micromanaging your many recruits. still, while youre actually in the field, the stealth gameplay feels excellent. but then it has the absolute worst story in the series. on the plus side... kinda... the vast majority of the story is on cassette tapes that are completely optional. only 1015 hours into this game and already its one of my favorites of all time. let me illustrate why via some comparisons. average call of duty mission walk in a straight line. kill some people. average f.e.a.r. mission walk in a straight line until you reach an arena where you will move around strategically and kill some people. average far cry 34 mission drive across the world until you reach the location. hide on a hill and snipe every bad guy at the base, then walk inside. or sneak inside, i dont care. this funnels you into a segment where you walk forward and kill people. average msgv mission you have 15 minutes to destroy enemy vehicles. their path is marked on your pip boy. call in a supply drop for a grenade launcher up ahead, then ride on your horse to get ahead of a tank, pick up the grenade launcher, and ambush the tank. next, ride across a bridge to the other side of a river, plant some c4, set up an ammo drop, go prone, and wait for another vehicle to pass by so you can blow it up. next, you get a message that a jeep is transporting a prisoner you need to extract. its across the river. user your sniper rifle to kill the driver and guard, run across the river, extract the prisoner, park the jeep in the middle of the road so that it stops the next vehicle that is coming your way. find a place to hide so you can ambush the vehicle. this is just the first half of the mission. and if you die, you can approach it a completely different way. this game feels like it takes far cry 4 and turns every gameplay element except for the open world up to 11. instead of just shutting down the radios at a base, you can destroy their comms equipment, their antiair radar, and their electrical power. dont just shut off the lightsshut off the lights, plant c4 on the power source, and then blow up the guy who comes by to turn the lights on. but be careful, because the enemies will react to anything you do. keep turning the lights off and they will start wearing nightvision goggles. the amount of things you can do in this game is amazing. even though the game is relatively difficult for me, anyway, it always feels fair. its always clear what killed me, and successfully completing a mission is less a matter of just getting better at doing a specific thing and more a matter of changing tactics. enemy behavior is some of the most realistic and immersive ive seen in a stealth game. sure, you can cheese the ai, but you really have to work for it, instead of just going round the corner so the enemies forget your presence. it really does feel like living through an awesome action movie rather than playing a video game. i only have a few complaints. one is that the open world really is empty theres nothing besides enemy bases. i wouldnt so much call this an open world game as an open arena game or a semisandbox game or something equally clunky. the goal of the open world in this game is not so much to simulate a living, breathing world like skyrim or far cry 4, but to give you a large area of operations for your missions. it succeeds in that regard, but i do wish there had been some more dynamic events happening. my other complaint is with the base management portion of the gameit feels like a mobile game, and takes away from the action. i want to be sneaking around and shooting stuff, not clicking through a menu. these are small complaints, however, and i can safely say that this game is one of the best games i have ever played. since the game regularly goes on sale for a steep discount, i heartily recommend buying it. one more thing you can put your own music into the game to play through your pokedex or on the helicopter. theres nothing quite as iconic as blasting through a base while back in black blares through the stereo, or having your chopper play born in the usa every time it picks you up. release the kojimas cut",14000.0,503.0,4500.0,1200.0,3.766521187482147,3.75,2015

The game combines characters and settings from Disney's animated features with those from the Final Fantasy series, developed by Square.
             

              Kingdom Hearts was a departure from Square's standard role-playing games by introducing a substantial action-adventure element. In addition, it has an all-star voice cast which included many of the Disney characters' official voice actors. Kingdom Hearts was longtime Square character designer Tetsuya Nomura's first time in a directorial position.

Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game.

135,sonic the hedgehog,1991-06-23,"Sonic Team , Sega",3.1,1100.0,Platform,"Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D, side-scrolling platformer, whose gameplay centers around Sonic's ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs, slopes, high falls, and loop-the-loops. The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (""badniks"" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground.
             

              Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection.
             

              The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress.
             

              At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues).
             

              When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a ""Secret Zone"" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a ""goal block"" (which ends the level).","recomendado, pero tener en cuenta que es la 1era entrega. no lo tenian todo atado the one that started it all and what a way to kick things off. a household gem of the sega systems and the source of many childhood memories for me. depois desse jogo..... teve vários outros jogos bons do sonic. divertido e simples, tudo que eu gosto. lixo, jogo desgraçado level design pavoroso dps da green hill zone detestei e foi uma das experiencias que mais me irritou nessa franquia inteira e olha que eu joguei sonic 2006 a masterpiece of design more than it is an actually great game. at the same time, if youre competing with mario, being able to have a style and sound profile that burns itself into a young mind is the only way to gain ground, since its gonna be really hard to make up that distance mechanically.",12000.0,60.0,804.0,243.0,3.2597996318501026,3.308641975308642,1991

176,halo 3,2007-09-25,"Bungie , Microsoft Game Studios",4.2,1600.0,Shooter,"Halo 3 is a shooter game where players primarily experience gameplay from a first-person perspective. Much of the gameplay takes place on foot, but also includes segments focused on vehicular combat. The balance of weapons and objects in the game was adjusted to better adhere to the ""Golden Triangle of Halo"": these are weapons, grenades, and melee attacks, which are available to a player in most situations. Players may dual-wield some weapons, forgoing the use of grenades and melee attacks in favor of the combined firepower of two weapons. Many weapons available in previous installments of the series return with minor cosmetic and power alterations. Unlike previous installments, the player's secondary weapon is visible on their player model, holstered or slung across the player's back.
              
              Halo 3 introduces ""support weapons"", which are cumbersome two-handed weapons that slow the player, but offer greatly increased firepower in return. In addition to weapons, the game contains a new class of gear called equipment; these items have various effects, ranging from defensive screens to shield regeneration and flares. Only one piece of equipment can be carried at a time. The game's vehicular component has been expanded with new drivable and AI-only vehicles.","just reminiscing about the game its fine, but honestly my main memory of this game is watching people i know rage so hard at it despite it coming out the same year as team fortress 2, which was at the time was both welcoming and encouraging. it felt like a misery generator and these people would not detach themselves from it. putting it another way, these are fun big budget games and the treatment of them as a serious competitive format feels more like a sunk cost fallacy than an honest assessment of what these games are capable of. halo 3 is how you conclude a trilogy. similar to halo 2, it keeps what works, improves upon that foundation, and built upon it and addresses certain criticisms. switching between halo 2 anniversary to halo 3 is a tad jarring at first, but halo 3 is still a beautiful game with amazing art direction. in terms of atmosphere, i think its the most wellrealised. beginning with the lush jungles and progressing from there. one of the best shooters ever made funniest shit ive ever seen. my childhood, part 3.",12000.0,101.0,1500.0,528.0,4.080962967175101,2.840909090909091,2007

One key aspect introduced in this title is the simultaneous multiplayer: while not the first game in the series to do so, it is the first 3D title in the Mario series to incorporate up to four players cooperating with each other to reach the goal. Players can select their character from a pool of playable characters prior to starting the game, and each of these characters have their own unique playstyle that gives them advantages and disadvantages over other characters. The game makes use of several Wii U exclusive features, such as tapping blocks with the touch screen on the GamePad and blowing into the mic to reveal hidden items and blow away enemies. Various new power-ups are introduced in this title, with the trademark suit being the Cat power-up, which enables characters to perform a melee attack, climb up walls, and leap while midair, as well as the game generally having a cat-based theme.","é o meu game de plantaforma preferido, ja zerei diversas vezes, e nunca deixa de ser divertido.  pode ser jogado com até 4 pessoas better than most games that arent 3d mario. best mario game i have ever played. this game is pure joy. my status 3d land , ma meglio. tornare a usare più personaggi è una boccata daria fresca. il multiplayer è divertentissimo per quanto non sia studiato per questo il gioco. level design stellare e soddisfacente da completare. un po un peso completare tutti i livelli con tutti i personnaggi ... when i unlocked rosalina i immediately played the entire game again as her",9600.0,93.0,787.0,432.0,3.8290104986030133,1.8217592592592593,2013

Players take on the role of Phoenix Wright, a defense attorney known for taking on seemingly impossible cases. While the game focuses on a few specific cases, the overarching story of the Phoenix Wright franchise spans the length of the series, involving obscure characters from large families and intricate webs of lies, plots, and murder. The nature of the series remains generally lighthearted, something that's reinforced by its playful, anime-inspired visual style, but the nature of the crimes committed can be cold and downright disturbing. While the game's legal acumen is highly dubious, its aim seems to be more about producing comedic or stereotypically dramatic courtroom moments. Ace Attorney 3 makes light use of the DS touch screen, allowing the player to examine crime scenes and inspect evidence and character profiles. The top screen is used more for storytelling purposes, displaying various dialogue and conversations between characters. During these sequences the lower screen becomes a selection menu, displaying a series of questions to ask witnesses and further your investigation in search of evidence to use in defense of your client in each chapter.","ace attorney at its best. this one is more ace attorney, but it puts so many spins on the formula that everything feels new. i liked this game but i found godot to be pretty annoying tbh kino, based, raw, peak fiction, etc. etc. the only game from the original trilogy that the fandom has the right opinion about fey supremacy yeah this is without a doubt the best of the original trilogy",6600.0,172.0,1600.0,623.0,4.1690841296601375,2.568218298555377,2006

              This game features a wonderfully subdued world, an intriguingly voiced narrative, and things that are really weird.","the vibes are on point mó brisado acabare con todas las maquinas expendedoras del universo lo juro. i remember back when this was a concept video, and was super intrigued by the gameplay mechanics. im glad that the game actually found a final version, and wasnt just a concept with nothing done with it as for the actual game itself, it was neat. i liked how they focused a lot on perspective based puzzles not only with the main gimmick of resizing objects based on perspective, but also with things like lighting and making 2d objects 3d, and resizing yourself to solve puzzles. however, there definitely were a lot of points where you are just walking through hallways, which felt like padding. it seems like while the game concept was really cool, there really wasnt a lot you could properly do to put those cool mechanics into practice to make the game the next portal like everyone thought it would be when it was shown off. that being said, portal is a really high bar, so not reaching that expectation does not a bad game make, since this game is still definitely worth playing imo. the story focusing on having different perspectives was also neat and tied into the game mechanics, which was cool. all in all, it didnt disappoint and i would recommend giving it a play up there with the portal series as one of the best puzzle games for me. im not one of the best or brightest and so having puzzles centered around one thing like portals or in this case, perspective, means that its not too difficult to figure out what you may want to do. each puzzle is really cool obviously, the use of perspective to fiddle with objects is trippy and fun to just mess with. my personal favorite part of the game was the level design and the way it made you feel like you were spiraling ever deeper in a dream. from the endlessly carpeted halls of a hotel to spooky dimly lit backrooms i was on the edge of my seat on this ride. at the very climax of the game, when you have been spiraling ever deeper trapped in this dream, the entire thing is kind of thrown away. while the ending still works avoiding too much for spoilers it was a bit of a punch in the gut to go from oh my god im dying to its all good its the end . still i think this game is one of my favorites and everyone should play it. clever and mind bending",3800.0,76.0,1000.0,917.0,3.625777310654082,1.0905125408942202,2019

Interactive Entertainment, which takes place in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Legendarium.
             

              The game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life.
             

              The game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor.
             

              The melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm, using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player's combo multiplier.
             

              A unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory. These enemies will continue to do their own jobs and tasks even when they're off screen. If the player does not kill an enemy in an encounter, this enemy will remember the player and change their tactics and conversations based on the encounter.","it has combat from arkham and assassins creed, climbing from uncharted, stealth from every 7th gen third person game, you spend half of the time clearing out bandit camps, and you play the most ai generated character in all of gaming. im sure we all remember that iconic lord of the rings characters name. this is a game so derivative of every other game around it that it lacks any identity and purpose to exist. monolith is an underrated company. fear was an underrated franchise in general, although the 3rd kind of fell flat. luckily they managed to claim some of the respect they were due with this game. a jogabilidade é muito boa o jogo tem um sistema de combate bem dinâmico, com muitos movimentos e habilidades que você pode aprender ao longo do jogo. além disso, o jogo tem o sistema nêmesis, onde os inimigos que você enfrenta vão se lembrar de você e evoluir de acordo com suas ações e para mim é o ponto alto do jogo. honestly not even that good of a game but i had a blast with the nemesis system and i enjoyed doing mindless treasure huntingrepetitive missions just because i liked making uruks feel as much pain as possible. would recommend to family and friends. its assassins creed in middle earth. whats not to love the nemesis system is still, to this day, one of the coolest things ive ever seen in a video game and its a shame that wb has done nothing with it since. disclaimer these are my brief thoughts based on my memory of playing this 8 years ago manswine",8400.0,106.0,1700.0,478.0,3.516752815299235,3.5564853556485354,2014

Unfortunately the prince stands a little less than half a foot tall, so recreating the stars will require some effort. Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to “roll up” items increasing the Katamari’s size until it’s suitable for the King.
             

              Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items.
             

              Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari’s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions.

Fan-favorite character, Chloe Frazer, must enlist the aid of renowned mercenary Nadine Ross from Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End in order to recover a fabled ancient Indian artifact and keep it out of the hands of a ruthless war profiteer. Together, they’ll venture deep into the mountains of India in search of the legendary artifact. Along the way, they’ll learn to work together to unearth the mystery of the artifact, fight their way through fierce opposition, and prevent the region from falling into chaos.","i was worried that the retirement of nathan would leave uncharted without anything to carry a story, as i never considered chloe a very interesting character in 2. thankfully, lost legacy compensates nicely with a shorter story, that doesnt ask too much of the player while still hitting all the correct beats. the gameplay improvements made in 4 make a triumphant return, though the climbing is still annoying. each big setpiece is dynamic and exciting, the game never lingers too long or moves on too quickly. on the openzone section in the beginning i have conflicted feelings. on one hand, the dialouge between chloe and nadine is charming and entertaining without feeling too artificial, and i enjoyed the scenery. however, this series has always been about maintaining momentum. i now have a newfound appreciation for the sublime pacing of the older games, after experiencing what it feels like to lose that forwardmoving feeling. the game definietly picks up the tempo again afterwards, but i cant say the section left a good impression overall. the rest of the game is exactly as one would expect. the villain is nothing special, the platforming is cool and rhytmic, but not very complex, and there arent really any themes to delve into beyond the absolute minimum stuff. i dont mind though, i am satisfied with the game being a nice adventure to relax with, a role it easily fulfills. the final uncharted game for now atleast and its....fine. bom a dlc do melhor jogo já feito, logo, a melhor dlc já feita. fun game, but generic as generic can possibly be. amy hennig as a writer was the soul of this franchise and without her uncharted became stale. neil druckmann gives you a modest american movie, but as a videogame he gives the most generic story possible and fails to write chloe as a charismatic protagonist  he transformed her in another nathan drake . every action scene is copied from another uncharted game and the structure add nothing to mechanics and functionality. the villain is bland and the male characters are there to fill the misandry quota. all the merits of this game still belongs to uncharted 1,2 and 3. play only if you want a little movie experience, or watch the cutscenes on youtube. everyone told me that uncharted was a videogame franchise with no bad games, well what do you call this garbage then the story is that chloe hires nadine from the fourth game to help her retrieve a ancient indian artifact, this is an odd idea for a story, because chloe knows about nadines history with her friends nathan and sam drake, yet she works with someone who hates them, and doesnt think she will turn on her, and when she finds out that sam was helping out, nadine feels betrayed, assaults chloe, and abandons her, until she apologizes, but nadine says that she is now only helping chloe out for the treasure, but dont worry, she gets over it randomly after they help a trapped elephant, it happens so fast that there isnt even a moment where nadine is completely over it, she randomly is, and they both act like it never happened, because the writing is terrible, when it comes to the character moments, and after they are trapped with sam, him and nadine both argue a lot, because of their history, but when interacting, chloe trusts the girl who assaulted her and tried to kill her former lover, and his brother, more than she trusts her former lovers brother, which feels like feminism, where the two girls get along, where as the man is played for a foil to it, which is frowned upon in this, and since nadine never shows any remorse for what she did in the last game to the protagonist, and sam does, it makes nadine even less likeable than she already was, and ruins the story completely, and studios need to stop this garbage. the characters are no where near as good as their last previous appearances, thanks to chloe being sympathetic to a former villain over a man, nadine worsened by trying to make us like her, by being an unlikeable villain to hero tale, without even regretting her actions, and made sam to feel more of a nuisance than a main character, to the point where he doesnt even bring his own grapple hook even though he would never do that, stop writing feminism over males feelings in games, and shame the people who think otherwise, the villain is barely anymore interesting than the first games main villain, with his history with an old kingdom, but it doesnt go beyond that, and i enjoyed the traits of the second games main villain more. the graphics are as good as the remastered versions of the first 3 games, with some moments are awe the best being when you run off a train heading off a broken bridge, even if the second games train scene was much better, but no where near as good as the fourth game, and not as many memorable moments to be on par with games 2 and 3, they have better looking events than the first game though. the gameplay is the same as before, only shorter to the point where its less than half the length of games 2, 3, and 4, and in chapter 4, you can optionally find coins to retrieve a ruby bracelet, but no other moments like it make it feel random, silenced pistols were a great addition, but chapters 5, and especially 4 feel far too long, and could have been shortened, to make 2 more chapters, especially with how big you have to travel for completing chapter 4 is. the music is not as memorable as before due to less moments to have them takeover the scene for atmosphere, and the song at the end borders, by m.i.a is a bland and forgettable song.

The player, in control of Clementine, can direct the character around the environment, examine and interact with various scenery elements and collect and use objects to advance the story. The player can also initiate conversations with non-player characters via conversation trees. Certain replies from other characters may offer the player multiple choices to select from, including the option to stay silent, with a limited amount of time to make the selection; if the player does not select an option, the conversation will continue as if they had stayed quiet. Such choices can affect how the other characters will later react to Clementine which can influence later events in the story. Other scenes are more action-oriented, requiring the player to complete quick time events to avoid Clementine or her allies from getting killed. If the player fails these events, the game will restart at the start of such scenes. Such action scenes may also require the player to make a key decision within a limited time frame, such as which of two characters to save from attacking walkers.","bastante más lento, llama la atención algunas apariciones pero no mucho más, las decisiones realmente no influyen como se vende played before 2023 the characters and choices arent as strong, but as someone who thought that i would hate playing as clementine, i was completely wrong. i really enjoyed it a lot, and i think that the choice at the end was a much stronger ending in terms of being based off your actions. but definitely didnt hit the same as the original. the adults in this game get on my nerves to the point i was yelling at the screen for half of it clementine proves she can hold her own as a main character in this follow up. feels like it is missing a bit of the magic of the original but still a stressful journey through kirkmans world. everything about thisgame is amazing the first game is so good, and i just never clicked with this one. its good, but it doesnt hit as hard.",6700.0,35.0,718.0,262.0,3.5683086874032424,2.7404580152671754,2013

The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots (also called pellets or just dots). When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. Four enemies (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost and the Pac-Man itself withers and dies. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter as the game progresses.","pacman is such a fucking idiot jesus christ. who decided to make this stupid yellow fucking circle the protagonist of a game. he never even listens to simple goddamn instructions, he would rather die than fuction according to his intended fucking purpose. theres a reason hes piss colored, hes a fucking giant pissball that everyone should hate. fuck you pacman one of the all time classics, and with good reason. its pacman, do i really need to explain what this game is eat dot, get chased by ghost, big dot means you can eat ghost. the concept is addicting but i believe the true reason why this game popped off hard was due to its character. no longer were you shooting aliens in a generic spaceship, you were a character with a name getting chased by other characters with names and even their own personalities. i dont know if this was the first game ever to do such a thing probably not, but it was the first to do it and really explode in popularity. the power dynamic flipping whenever you get a power pellet is also a pretty cartoony mechanic in its own right which makes the game just have this cartoonish charm. theres also very basic cutscenes every couple of levels that give a decent break in the action. pac man is cool, one of the most classic arcade games of all time. literal definition of mid. but i could see this being pretty fun with friends. pac these nuts. gottem. more like mid man crazy how that man is pac",5200.0,7.0,108.0,31.0,3.529725350332484,3.4838709677419355,1980

gambling system to determine rank, and to its credit, does a good job at first of hiding how retardedly paytowin it is. then you reach either a high enough rank or high enough collector level and realize if youre not spending 20 a month, youre not winning games consistently. still playing it time to time but, as every card game, i got tired. this does not mean that the game is not a blast it is actually the first card game ive played for so long and with so much enjoyment. highly recommend marvel snap was the biggest surprise of 2022. i have never been a fan of card game portions of games. less than 5 hours of my life as geralt was spent on gwent, triple triad in ffxiv does nothing for me and i actively despised joustus in king of cards. im also not a big fan of mobile games as they are typically shallow affairs that never hold my attention. so for marvel snap to be my most played game to release in 2022 and a near everpresent in my daily life, they must have got something right. the key to marvel snap is that its easy to pick up and hard to master. each card is both a part of marvels illustrious history and a chess piece that can change the game if used correctly. a game of marvel snap lasts less than 5 minutes so its easy to justify trying different combination of cards as picking cards with poor synergy will not cost you much. the process of developing wining decks is as satisfying as learning the ropes in any fighting game. the games various locations that impact each match only add to the complexity as you alter your strategy based on there affects as well as your opponents moves. the snap is a genius mechanic that forces you to either call there bluff or fold like its a high stake poker game. the ability to upgrade your cards, so they are 3d holographic brings back childhood memories , alongside giving the game a engaging gameplay loop. upgrading your cards, daily challenges and season challenges keep me coming back day after day. not being able to buy unique cards is one of the best decisions the devs ever made and allows me to come back day after day unlocking new cards, getting a holographic card collection my childhood self could only dream of and switching between strategies to keep the game fresh is a wining formula where the marvel licence is only the cherry on top of a delicious cake. a card game with simple mechanics. easy to get into difficult to master. youll be surprised how many diverse decks you can come up with, with ass simple cards this game offers. each match takes about 2 minutes or so and every match feels unique enough to keep you engaged in its core gameplay loop. marvel snap is a bit like destiny 2, apex legends, and many others in the game as a service category a great game you probably shouldnt play. there is no denying that marvel snap is astoundingly great at being a quick and flashy 2player card battler card effects are superbly designed, so that almost every cards feels powerful and great to play decks are exactly 12 cards, so its easy to deckbuild, experiment, and try many different strategies and, at exactly 6 turns, each game is snappy i got used to firing up the matchmaking every time i have to go downstairs to grab a food delivery  and i live in the second story on my building. win or lose, youll play your cards, watch their flashy effects, and have your dopamine hit. it really does feel great. not to mention one of the best parts of the design, the titular snapping mechanic with one tap, you can stake your progression with a double or nothing gamble. no matter if youre really confident or just bluffing, the other player either needs to call it or concede defeat. this creates tension like a motherfucker. so let me get this straight, youre thinking. snap looks stunning, is polished to a shine, and feels genuinely great to play. whats the problem the price. by 2023, its basically a cliché to say freetoplay games are the most expensive in the market. everyone knows that. snap is no different. you will download the game for free, sure, but you will pay  if not with money, than with the bad feeling of playing a lesser game than everyone else, and having to grind more to be less competitive. youll always be behind on the new cards, and every game you lose will remind you this problema can be solved with your credit card. just get it, youll think. its just the price of an indie game per month to keep on top of the season passes, youll think. it wont bankrupt me, youll think. i dont even have time to play a new indie game every month to completion. this game brings me fun consistently. i like marvel heroes pretend its a subscription youll think all of these things and others to justify continuously spending time on intangible items that would have been unlockable through gameplay if this was a good old regular paid game as god intended. and then one day youll write a review on marvel snap on letterboxd and, as you write, youll realize what an idiot youve been to think this was okay. and you will decide, right then and there, while writing the penultimate paragraph, to just uninstall snap and get a new indie game instead. i think ill start with pizza tower. yeah.  i hear great things, and its even cheaper than a snap season pass. now that feels great.  i once heard that the act of writing is in itself the act of thinking, just a bit slower and more methodical. i can now state with confidence that tracks. i played this game every day between october 1 and february 7. the gameplay of snap is excellent, and for a while the treadmill is really enticingi earned new cards at a pace and in an order that successfully sparked some inspiration in the new combos i could try. when that happened, i could play dozens of games whittling the new deck and strategy down, until i got something new that did the same thing, and so on. as deck variety increases so does strategic complexity, and the game is excellent at getting you time and opportunity to explore its systems theres not many explicit tutorials, but the card effects are simple and the at your decks grows feels so natural. it must be said the card game itself feels really welldesigned and balanced, and for many characters right on theme. i had a great time for a long time.",847.0,248.0,54.0,22.0,3.6700876722565625,2.4545454545454546,2022

It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989.
             

              The Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards.
             

              The game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010). A remastered, high-definition, version of The Sands of Time was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on November 16, 2010.","prince of persia the sands of time is without question one of the most influential platformers ever made. its easy to trace its legacy during play. moments where ledges fall away, revealing a specific path for the prince to climb on, or removing pieces of scaffolding that the player balances on have been redone again and again and again. uncharted , god of war , tomb raider , jedi fallen order , and many more all follow in the example that this game set, if in an extremely diluted way. so, does this original version stand up to the test of time i would say it does fairly well. gamecube was such a good era this game is considered a classic and it deserves to be. it does go on a little longer than id like, and the combat is a little barebones, but thats about it. i was one of the idiots that played this game on steam. its an awful windows game, as it is heavily bugged and requires a lot of time and effort to make it playable. however, i gave it another go since i acquired the steam deck. playing this game through proton actually fixes a lot of the issues with playing the game on a modern windows system. you would still have to do a couple of things to get it working as if it was native to the system, but the amount of effort required is much less on the steam deck than a modern windows machine. esses jogos sao mto subestimados polished yet monotonous. after the initial exposition youre left going from platforming to combat for hours without a single drop of narrative. progressing through the game is fun though, so if you dont pay much attention to story either way have a blast. id argue this game couldve been inspiration for the uncharted series as theres plenty of parallels.",5500.0,37.0,1100.0,421.0,3.6259721715337565,2.6128266033254155,2003

645,tekken 3,1997-03-22,"Namco , Namco Hometek",3.9,564.0,Fighting,"Tekken 3 maintains the same core fighting system and concept as its predecessors, but brings many improvements, such as significantly more detailed graphics and animations, fifteen new characters added to the game's roster, more modern music and faster and more fluid gameplay.
              
              Perhaps the most noticeable change from Tekken 2 fight system is movement reform - whereas the element of depth had been largely insignificant in previous Tekken games (aside from some characters having unique sidesteps and dodging maneuvers), Tekken 3 added emphasis on the third axis, allowing all characters to sidestep in or out of the background by lightly pressing the arcade stick (or tapping the controller button in the console version) towards the corresponding direction. Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn't connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws.
             

              Tekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat 'em up minigame called ""Tekken Force"", which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first). This was continued in Tekken 4 and succeeded by the Devil Within minigame in Tekken 5 - but Boskonovitch was dropped as a playable character after Tekken 3. There is also a minigame ""Tekken Ball"", similar to beach volleyball, where one has to hit the ball with a powerful attack to hurt the opponent or try to hit the ball in such a way that it hits the ground in the opponent's area, thus causing damage.","deserves the praises that it gets. revolutionized the 3d fighting game genre, and is basically the street fighter 2 for 3d fighters. youd think that after tekken 2 set the bar so high, that there would be nowhere to go but down from here, but they just kept making the game even better. we have an entirely new fresh set of characters here, the gameplay has been polished to a fine sheen, and theres a ton of bonus modes you can play that inadvertently give you practice for the main fighting mode, which is awesome since the normal training mode labbing can sometimes not be everyones cup of tea. the other gamemodes also give lonely fighters like myself much more to do than just playing arcade mode and getting clapped by dumb ai enemies over and over. this is pretty much the golden standard of tekken, and theres a reason why this game is rated so highly not just among tekken games, but even among fighting game titles and overall ps1 games. the first truly 3d fighting game, you can get some really spectacular fights especially if you know what youre doing which i dont. unfortunately the spectacle is reserved for a fraction of the characters. a quarter of the roster is complete dogshit, and another quarter is just kinda meh. playing a character as bland as nina after flipping and kicking around with eddy is just too jarring. i need a hero and jin is the hero in this game. 55 just kinda love the style of this. the soundtrack is awesome and the characters are awesome and i love sidestepping a huge step up from the last two entries of the series. the ai can be challenging, but not unfair and the combat feels so smooth. the side modes in this game are really fun, tekken force being a great addition. the cinematics are great and tell fun stories while also boasting a big step up visually compared to its predecessor. tekken 3 really is still worth trying, even over 20 years later.",4200.0,13.0,253.0,183.0,3.791336862218077,1.3825136612021858,1997

The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the few upcoming ally and enemy turns are shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's ""boost"" gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts.
             

              Each character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS.","definitely more cutscene than game here, i wasnt doing much with the controller through this game. however, the plot and characters are really neat and the game definitely kept me on the edge of my seat as i watched the cool space shenanigans that the party goes through. this game does an incredible job at introducing the world and characters in a way where i really got to know them but at the same time still was intrigued by the backstories and future that they would have in later games. plot and cutscenes are 910. references to xenogears are neat. gameplay is mid and boring, and slow god bless turbo button. even tho i somehow enjoyed stats synchronization mechanic, but i think its not a feature, but an overlooked game design flaw  wont complain, being op is funny. also didnt like too easy to miss stuff  forgot to return to the room you left right now  you will miss entire sidequest with generous reward. also game has really obscure secrets where you need to be in particular place controlling particular character them being in your party isnt enough. my favorite one is playground in the beginning of the dungeon, you need to travel for about 20 minutes, just to get a card for a hidden minigame. it feels like they made it for replayability, but again in the end of the game there is a big middle finger for those who will decide to save clear data on the same save slot. because you cant load clear data  its for sequel to get few bonuses swimsuits and something else. theres no ng, theres no way to start from checkpoint before final boss, you just wasted all your progress. you also lose access to all minigames  therefore gameplay is 310 i dont remember any music during gameplay but in cutscenes it was good  710 interesting space opera which is unfortunately attached to a video game. but at least the video game has an in game glossary snoooooooooze boooooring miiiiiiiiid dnf, wish i did my personal fav of the 3",1200.0,103.0,1300.0,575.0,3.676049220093541,2.260869565217391,2002

dangerous version of science-fiction Hong Kong where you will need sharpened skills to survive.""","its really weird that the narrative around this game has become that its some kind of corporate money laundering affair or some other cheap passionless writeoff when its just, like, no obviously this is an extreme passion vanity project the likes of which rarely gets mass distribution in video games even in the indie scene, let alone a boxed product by a reputable developer. this is more like something that would get dropped by pendulum pictures on a box of 50 shot on video flicks than anything else. and guess what that is my entire vibe. every moment of a cutscene in this game is an unhinged surreal delight, cgi ps360 cutscene anime filtered through 9 layers of google translate. i cant tell you a thing that happened in this game but i can tell you that herzogs stories have more male nudity in them than a joaquin phoenix movie and i did a stunningly difficult karaoke minigame to 99 luftballoons while my character and stephanie joosten looked like they were singing at gunpoint. the weirdness carries over into the traditional levels too, with dialogue peppered in and just an incredible awkwardness to every combat encounter. guns are formally useless one of the things i think is surprisingly worse about this game next to devils third, a modern gaming classic and swordplay is very simplistic, but theres fun to be had in the rsi inducing button mashing, mostly because its really difficult so you have to actually learn parries and shit. there are encounters that are like pulling fucking teeth though, the boss fight against august is one of the absolute worst i can remember, the game is just not fair or deep or varied lol. it is fun tho. i like the lil hub zone too, love a hub, love wandering around hearing the inscrutable cop dialogue. this game is set in hong kong but theres like no chinese characters at all also its explicitly set in 2022 so i guess its alt history sometimes the cutscenes are anime sometimes you see actual stephanie joosten playing with her band wanted dead is when soleil games played one of d3 publishers many bargain bin action games like onechanbara but realized they didnt have the talent to actually make something closely on par. soleil also clearly doesnt have the humility to price wanted dead as the unfinished bargain bin title it is, either. skip it. this game is not very good. i had a very good time though. its flawed, but oozes charm. like, the bizarre dialogue coupled with iffy voice acting with an extra dose of horrible sound mixing should be a recipe for a bad time. but i found it very endearing. the actual story is not good, though. it starts off interesting, but has absolutely zero payoff in any way, shape, or form. i dont know if this is a time or budget constraint or its just bad on its own. either way, it doesnt really matter to me. the gameplay is a mix of linear combat levels, with some minigames and exploration of the police station in between them. the minigames are fun on the first go, but i never went back for seconds. and exploring the station was fun the first time, but after that you just kinda mindlessly run around it looking for new intel pickups after every level. its nothing special, but offers a nice repose from the combat. the combat is pretty simple, but effective. you have a sword, and some guns. i mostly played aggressively, not using guns for the most part. just slashing around, and finding it very fun. attacking, and parrying. this being a game made by former ninja gaiden devs, im sure theres plenty of secret techniques that deepen the combat. but im a scrub, and dont know anything about that. i did discover block canceling tho, and felt like a genius. the actual game is pretty hard. those ninjas, man a nice challenge is a good thing, but the checkpoint placement really grinded my gears. dying could mean having to repeat like 5 minutes of constant combat which gets pretty annoying. but other than that, i honestly had a fun time. damn i wish they still made rough janky action games that got critically eviscerated like the ps2 days. no no not like that its too rough and janky, and look at those reviews its being critically eviscerated you know i knew exactly what i was getting into with this game and yet somehow i still left disappointed lol. while this game has a lot of charm and fun combat  can be clunky at times  there is still so much wrong with this game. as someone who saw promise in the developers previous works, and after seeing the interesting flavor wanted dead was putting on display in its advertising, i was truly hopeful that the game would finally squeak past that threshold of being just short of greatness and deliver something flawed but truly excellent or interesting in its own right. unfortunately, this one just wasnt it for me,

gamer ever made everything about this game is amazing, the music, characters, replay value, world building, story and gameplay, its all so perfectly crafted that i cannot believe not many people has played it yet. sigurd is one of the best lords if not the best lord in the series, his whole journey and how it ends is amazing, i love it so much. played a ranked run but got a mediocre b rank, still had tons of fun and i would play it again genealogy of the holy war is almost less of a game and more like a story that you interact with. if it wasnt for the near unrivaled mix of worldbuilding with gameplay i would not like fe4 as much as i did. despite birthing some elements that would be integral to fire emblem as a franchise going forward, its also the most unique entry in the series by far. even with all of its influence and acclaim, not one game past this has ever tried replicating everything this game did. some of that could be attributed to the new systems being seen more as flaws rather than benefits, or the sheer complexity maybe too scary for newer players. im not sure. i finished this game over a week ago, and ive been banging my head on the wall trying to figure out what to say. i feel like i need to get the word out of what this game is, but its just not fully coming to me. id love to write a review as long as a single enemy phase in this game but i really cant do that as much as i try. so ill suffice by writing something shorter while explaining why you should at least experience this game once. war. legacy. succession. betrayal. tragedy. these are all themes that genealogy of the holy war focuses on. fire emblem has.. well obviously always been about war. however genealogy , out of all the games ive experienced, delves the most into the pure tragedy and unfairness of what war is. there are so many moments where you just.. cant save everyone. the other games have similar moments, but this one melds it into the gameplay so perfectly and precisely. every map is vast with history, communities, and density. they genuinely do feel like actual locales rather than a video game level. that goes both to its benefit and detriment from a gameplay perspective, but from a story perspective, its pure bliss. we follow our heroes through lush forests, sprawling plains, harsh mountains, scorching deserts etc. you slowly proceed through this seemingly endless war, each map becoming more and more hopeless. i should also preface that you need to experience this story blind. i know its very hard to do as such with how much the middle plot twist is spoiled to everyone, but i encourage you to stay as blind as possible. genealogys narrative is fantastic, not only for a fire emblem game but for a piece of media in general. seliph is one of my favorite video game characters of all time because of how we follow his journey from suffering a harsh young life, but growing to become a fine young man himself capable of what his mission is. once again, im not going to elaborate so the reader can find out what happens themselves, but the story is, no exaggeration, simply masterful. generational storytelling is one of my favorite tropes of all time. seeing how descendants of a generation will remedy the mistakes, regrets, or failures of their predecessors has always been so engaging to me. while genealogys latter half isnt nearly as narratively complex as the former half, its story about the next generation of heroes is among one of my favorites for this trope. ily seliph. presentation also goes a long way, of course. every music track in the game adds to the atmosphere so heavily, its easily one of the best soundtracks ive heard on the super famicom. some tracks were so masterfully composed i nearly shed tears, i couldnt believe how well it played me especially when i can rarely cry at soundtracks anymore. the graphics can be hit or miss, especially with the character portraits, but the maps and environments are top notch. i could really look at them for so long. i think thats pretty much all i could think of to say about genealogy of the holy war . as a game its a mess. possibly even objectively bad. but as a story, a piece of artistry its an undeniable masterpiece. its certainly not for everyone, im aware, but it is worth experiencing in full at least once. not my favorite fire emblem because of the gameplay, but definitely the best narrative and cast of characters in my eyes. also ever notice how so many of the people who say this game sucks or other classic fe games for that matter are three houses fans or have three houses pfps curious . a great game, and my favorite of the fire emblem franchise. the game is kind of easy for a fire emblem game, and its clearly not the best tactical experience youll get in this franchie. this game is more a playable story than it is a game with a good story in it. every element of genealogy serves the narrative, the strenght of the characters reflects their developpement and their place in the world, the challenges are constantly evolving to flow with the story, story events that you cant even participate in take place during fights... this allow the universe to feel real, and we can feel the stakes of whats happening. its clearly not a game for everyone, it can be slow and tedious at times, and the story can be less interesting in the second half, but if you think a game using his mecanics mainly to tell a compelling plot with memorable characters may be for you, ill blindy recommand that you at least give it a try. dont be afraid of the difficulty if youre not used to play old fire emblem games, you can save litteraly every turn, and you have broken characters among your units.",1300.0,81.0,836.0,385.0,3.8311271672212897,2.1714285714285713,1996

The player moves about the game through still images of locations. The player can use the DS touchscreen to tap on non-player characters to start a dialog or to obtain a puzzle, and also can search anywhere on the background for hint coins, with some areas needing to be tapped several times to reveal a secret hint coin or puzzle. Puzzles are brainteasers of many varieties, including visual, math, and logic. There is no time limit to solve puzzles, and the player can get up to 3 hints at a cost of one hint coin each; a new feature in Unwound Future is a ""super hint"", costing 2 coins, that can only be bought after the other 3 hints have been revealed, but that nearly reveals the puzzle's solution. If the player is correct in solving the puzzle, they gain a number of ""Picarats"", a form of currency within the game. Guessing the incorrect answer will reduce the number of picarats the player can get on subsequent attempts. Players can visit certain areas in order to play undiscovered or unsolved puzzles that are left behind as the story progresses.","1010 would cry again man what a great game, by far the best in the series so far the game was a joy to play, the story was great and even tho i was spoiled out of context i knew there was a twist, but the game was great, the ending even made me cry which few games make me cry. the puzzles were great and varied with lots of different side modes to do. muchos puzzles de relojes, una ambientación que no llega a la altura de st. mystère o folsense, pero lo compensa con creces dando desarrollo y puñaladas emocionales. el mas mejor de los layton, pero con razon este es apodado profesor layton y el trauma emocional the puzzles, characters, story and everything are at their best in this game. its a step up from the previous 2 and is probably one of the best games ive ever played after hearing that unwound future was unanimously considered the best out of the series, i decided to give professor layton one last chance. but even still, i just really can not wrap my head around what is so enjoyable about these games. i want to like it so, so badly. i can see the good parts, like the art and the music and the atmosphere, but its almost like the game uses that to masquerade as a better experience than it is. i look at professor layton and i think, wow, what a charming little world but playing through unwound future was one of the most miserable experiences ive ever had with a game, of course.",2400.0,33.0,664.0,388.0,3.950303678204197,1.711340206185567,2008

752,fire emblem: thracia 776,1999-09-01,"Intelligent Systems Co., Ltd. , Nintendo",4.1,329.0,"Rpg , Strategy , Tactical","Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 is a Japanese tactical role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo, and the fifth installment in the Fire Emblem series. It is also the third and final Fire Emblem series title to be released on the Super Famicom.
             

              Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 takes place between Chapters 5 and 6 of the previous game, Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu. Several characters from Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu appear, such as Leaf, Fin, and Nanna. It takes place in the Thracian peninsula in southeastern Jugdral.","theres genuinely nothing funny i could say about thracia, or anything that hasnt already been said about it that would do it justice. theres no other fe game that matches its raw gameplay integrity and absolutely genius ideas, with genealogy at least coming in close second. for every bullshit thing the game throws at you, the game gives you quadruple the amount of bullshit to use against the enemy  like there are so many brave and master weapons and staves that basically get handed to you on a silver platter, and while there are a few chapters that are trial and error, actually figuring them out genuinely feels so good  no other fire emblem game gives me this much dopamine. hell, i made a long ass text file documenting my experiences with the game, going in depth on every strategy i utilised in every chapter and giving pointers and advice that either myself or someone else could use whenever they decide to play. i think its worth mentioning that this is the first time a game has compelled me to do something like this. amei as mecânicas do jogo espero que apareça em outros jogos ou algum futuro remake me diverti bem mais com esse comparado com o fe4 envelheceu bem demais e algum dia vou revisitar mesmo com toda raiva que passei em alguns mapas im never touching this game for the rest of my life. i have never felt such hatred inside of me until i played this game. the story and characters really carry this game. take me back to genealogy please. also, fuck the ballistae in this game. its the kind of game that will kick in the stomach, laugh and continue to kick you, until its get tired, but when it does, it will extend you a hand and treat you like a hero. play it if you have some experience with tactical games otherwise you will have a bad time. oh my god. i cant believe i slept on this game kept it for last thinking it would be too hard for me. despite being on the snes, its an absolute masterpiece of a game, which can be attributed to the fact it tests the snes to its limits, being the final snes game ever made, released in 1999, nine years after the sness inception, and 3 years into the n64s lifespan. shouzou kaga was evidently opposed to making a fire emblem game on the n64, believing the 3d graphics would hurt the appearance of his characters, and that philosophy to keep the characters 2d carried over to the ps1s tear ring saga yutona heroes war chronicles. that too went well, but lets focus on fe5. this game probably took about 10 years from my lifespan but i still loved it, the infamous difficulty of the game is actually really satisfying and well balanced especially in the first half, but after chapter 18 or so is.... painful, to say the least. still, after strategizing for hours, constantly saving and loading states and rage moments,sense of accomplishment i get from beating a stage from a 24 year old srpg is remarkable probably my favorite aspect about fe5 is the overall tone of it. while fe4 had its fair share of dark moments, this game is straight up depressing, you actually feel how bleak and despair the situation is in every chapter. by the beggining of the game, you feel completely lost,and confused by the mechanics and the difficulty, just like leif, feeling lost on this brutal war. you are not a group of experienced and heroic knights, leading for victory, you are mostly common folk going against a full fledged empire, and youre obviously going to get obliterated against such force. but as you learn the mechanics of the game and gain strong units, a hope slowly rises, and you go from how the hell am i going to survive from this to hey, i can actually do this and you start to command larger armies on bigger maps. and then, you are facing with the strongest forces of the empire. its actually even harder then before, but you have so much more experince with the game,you dont feel as powerless as before. and after youve gone through so much, beating the game and seeing those credits rolled is one of the most rewarding feelings a game can give to you this, is phenomenal storytelling, and you can only have this in a videogame, that unforgiving difficulty is one of the finest examples of storytelling through gameplay. thats why remake of this game is probably going to suck, since theyll inevatiabely tone down the difficulty. gameplay has a surprising amount of resource management, and i love this, you can capture enemies to steal their equipment,but its significantly harder and risky to do,since youll deal much less and take much more damage. but since you dont get much chance to buy and repair weapons, you really have to pay attention the resources you have, and use them in the most efficient way to overcome challenges you face fatigue is also a new mechanic, which if you use a unit too much, you wont be able to use them in the next chapter, which makes powerful units more tricky to use, adding another depth to the gameplay. youll only want to use them when necessary, so you actually have a reason to use less powerful units, i gotta say this was hard to get used to, especially after i obliterated every enemy with ayra and larcei in fe4, but it didnt took long to for me to actually like it also fantastic map designs suplements the complex gameplay mechanics brilliantly. fe5 abandons the massive maps of fe4 in favor of smaller, but focused maps with multiple objectives, and while some enemy placements made me want to torn apart my bone structure from my skinthose goddamn ballistas will give me nightmares for the most part i really apprecieted the variety in both the map design and objectives. you have defense, escape, fog of warwhich isnt that bad in my opinion and of course normal seize missions. also each map has its own unique objective, which makes every single map even more memorable. varied objectives makes each chapter fresh, which is something ive never seen in an srpg weakest part of this game imo are the characters, in fe4, you have a lot of optional conversations between characters, and those conversations actually give a decent personality and development to each unit, in fe5, most of the cast has 5 lines of dialogues at most, and all of them are in the chapter you recruit them. but i really like how the game tells what happened to them after the credits rolled though this doesnt mean that this game has no good character writing, far from it, leif is one the best written main characters ive ever seen in a game. like i mentioned before, you start of the game as powerless, and with zero knowledge on the complex mechanics of the game. just like leif, whos a 15 year old who has never commanded an army. this is obviously no coincidence, leif represents the player, but unlike most games that have a main character which isrepresenting the playerleif isnt a silent protagonist, his development from an inexperienced kid to a mature war commander is very natural, and paralells brilliantly with the development of you as a player, as you understand how the game works and start using the tools you have in the most optimal ways. leif alone is enough to say this game has fantastic character writing im not sure if fire emblem 5 is better than 4,but still, this is one the finest srpgs ever made. its frusturating for sure, but its so well designed in nearly every aspect, its impossible for me to hate it. id highly recommend it if you liked fe4, and simply want to see more from this world.",820.0,65.0,771.0,329.0,3.843290620439043,2.3434650455927053,1999

985,until dawn,2015-08-25,"Supermassive Games , Sony Computer Entertainment",3.4,812.0,Adventure,"Until Dawn is an interactive drama survival horror video game. It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support, but in August 2014, the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive.
             

              Until Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the ""Butterfly Effect"" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player's choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has ""hundreds of endings"". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game.
             

              The gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.
             

              Until Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story, mostly the second half, camera angles, character movements and partially linear plot.","sam i dont like this game. ive seen it all the way through like 4 times camp played before 2023 probably the game with the best choices in this narrativedriven style game where the choices do matter, even if they dont create much branching paths. the coolest part about this game is that, depending on your choices, everyone can survive or everyone can die and you dont really get that in many other games. i think it also had an okay story, feeling very stereotypical to make it easy for them to create characters. voice acting and performances are okay, but there is nothing interesting about the gameplay. qtes being essentially the only aspect of these type of games is fine, but they arent really done in interesting ways and there isnt much else outside of this. the areas you are walking around arent super interactable in heavy rain, and they arent wellpaced to explore like in twd. qtes are evil and i was going to give this 2 stars until i remembered that i didnt move my controller, i swear watched a playthrough of this and doesnt seem like itll change much if i play it. characters were interesting albeit kind of assholes lmao. enjoyable scares and different scenario possibilities are also really interesting to check out.",8000.0,85.0,1200.0,585.0,3.4900240308746087,2.051282051282051,2015

Pit of Kid Icarus fame is back in a new game designed specifically for the Nintendo 3DS system, by Masahiro Sakurai, creator of the Kirby and Super Smash Bros. franchises, and his development team at Project Sora.
             

              Kid Icarus: Uprising is a fast-paced and action-packed blend of aerial and ground-based shooting built on elegantly intuitive and streamlined play control. This follow-up to the original Kid Icarus released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987 has been at the top of gamers wish lists for years.
             

              Boasting gameplay that is easy to pick up but incredibly deep, the game is sure to satisfy novice gamers as well as fans who have been clamouring for a new installment in the franchise.
             

              The hero, Pit, teams up with Palutena, the goddess of light, who bestows on him the miracle of flight for limited stretches. With this gift, Pit soars through the skies, shooting down swarms of enemies, then alights and engages in frantic ground-based battles against Medusas underworld army.
             

              Find and collect numerous weapons and items that offer bonuses and ability boosts. Players can choose weapons before they send Pit into battle, giving them countless layers of strategies in each level.

Blades are well-balanced, Claws have limited reach but increase running speed and the Orbitars can shoot two shots that grow in power over distance.","another thing where if it got a remaster could be one of the very best. the controls hold it back at a fundamental level, and with the strives in accessibility in gaming made since its release im all but certain that would be alleviated in any kind of port. still an incredible game if youre able to play it, but there shouldnt be a barrier like that in the first place in an unexpected sequel, kid icarus finds new light in an amazingly lighthearted world. with incredible comedy that uses the medium to its advantage, characters will interact and bounce off of each other while still maintaining the overall plot. theres a really cool fakeout halfway through the game, for example. while struggling gameplaywise due to wanting to do so much on a 3ds, it still feels right at home. surprisingly good and kinda unique to be honest. the story has no right to have all these good plot twists and genuinely really funny dialogue. the carpal tunnel has left my wrists as nothing but nubs but it was worth it excelente historia y jugabilidad ojala salga una secuela",5400.0,140.0,1700.0,924.0,3.947664801562219,1.8398268398268398,2012

              Jet Set Radio was part of Sega's onslaught of new properties with an emphasis on flash and style during the second wave of Dreamcast software, but it might be one of the more obscure. It's a game that almost everyone has heard of, but I think few have actually played. This was remedied somewhat with 2002's Xbox sequel Jet Set Radio Future.

It was exclusively released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in August 1997.,"ive never seen a james bond movie. the only intake of 007 media is from this game. and to be honest, until i played through the entire campaign on switch online, the only experience i had with this game was from glimpses of my cousins playing through the campaign or from the short bursts of multiplayer theyd allowed me to participate in. playing through the game, ive realized how important this game truly is to the higher fps canon. nonlinear levels based on objectives along with fastpaced gunplay. varied weaponry that feels so good to maul down enemy combatants as they stalk you relentlessly. a smooth yet intense soundtrack from grant kirkhope. the dedication to its source material. goldeneye is still one of the best movie to game adaptations in history and people who complain about the controls are missing the point. yes, there are frustrating aspects to the gameplay, but when you get used to it, you realize you can gundown enemies with one hand and sip a glass of whiskey on the rocks in the other letting the left trigger and the auto aim do the rest. i couldve made a shaken not stirred martini reference but i dont know any bond references that werent made in this game. i thought the moonraker and golden gun were from this movie they arent from goldeneye thats cool that they added so many references to the whole franchise though even though it was lost on me even now. really wanted to give this game a chance, but by todays fps standards the controls have aged terribly. extraordinarily okay game, misogyny is so back 6 features goldeneye still gets right like almost no shooter and movie adaption today this game certainly has a legendary status for not only being a catalyst of console fps games but also for its phenomenal multiplayer where its just plain fun to blast away at your friends and scream at em for screenpeeking and picking oddjob. i had owned this game for years and not even touched the singleplayer mode, so i finally got around to doing the actual campaign and its aight. the controls take some time to get used to for sure but once i got over the learning curve it was very smooth sailing. i think my main gripe with the game is just that i dont know how the game wanted me to play the whole time. since the game was initially designed to be a gallery shooter before the devs switched to an fps, the levels are designed with a lot of choke points where there are a lot of enemies and one way to proceed. naturally, especially considering this game is a james bond game, the correct move would be to cautiously take out all the enemies before proceeding to the next area. unfortunately the game continues to spawn enemies infinitely if you decide to stay in one spot too long, so sometimes a better play would be to throw caution to the wind and just run through everyone blasting them like its doom. due to the fact that its hard to tell how the game wants you to play for each level plus the fact that each level is rather open and nonlinear, allowing the player to get lost frequently, it all blends together to create a rather unbalanced gameplay experience. the soundtrack is good, and graphically the environments are very nice looking on the n64, with far draw distances for the system and not too much slowdown. once again, the multiplayer is some of the most fun you can have on the n64. all in all, great with friends, eh by yourself. very fun shooter and multiplayer",4500.0,60.0,646.0,334.0,3.6227748398108512,1.9341317365269461,1997

              Street Fighter II is credited for starting the fighting game boom during the 1990s. Its success led to the production of several updated versions, each offering additional features and characters over previous versions, as well as many home versions. Some of the home versions of the Street Fighter II games have sold millions of copies, with the SNES port of the first Street Fighter II being Capcom's best-selling consumer game of all-time as of 2008.
             

              Street Fighter II follows several of the conventions and rules already established by its original 1987 predecessor. The player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent's vitality before the timer runs out. If both opponents knock each other out at the same time or the timer runs out with both fighters having an equal amount of vitality left, a ""double KO"" or ""draw game"" is declared and additional rounds will be played until sudden death. In the first Street Fighter II, a match could last up to ten rounds if there was no clear winner; this was reduced to four rounds in Champion Edition and onward. If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round, then either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a 2-player match.
             

              After every third match in the single player mode, the player will participate in a ""bonus game"" for additional points. The bonus games includes (in order) a car-breaking event; a barrel breaking bonus game where the barrels are dropped off from a conveyor belt above the player; and a drum-breaking bonus game where drums are flammable and piled over each other. The bonus games were removed from the arcade version of Super Street Fighter II Turbo.
             

              Like in the original, the game's controls uses a configuration of an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons. The player uses the joystick to jump, crouch and move the character towards or away from the opponent, as well as to guard the character from an opponent's attacks. There are three punch buttons and three kick buttons of differing strength and speed (Light, Medium and Heavy). The player can perform a variety of basic moves in any position, including grabbing/throwing attacks, which were not featured in the original Street Fighter. Like in the original, the player can perform special moves by inputting a combination of directional and button-based commands.
             

              Street Fighter II differs from the original due to the selection of multiple playable characters, each with their distinct fighting styles and special moves. Additionally, the player can also ""cancel"" during animation by performing another move, allowing for a combination of several basic and special moves. Both of these features would be expanded upon in subsequent installments.","the fighting game that redefined all fighting games. it created a whole new scene and entirely rejuvenated an entire industry. a cultural phenomenon. a real shock and masterpiece when it came out, the most playable existing port of the smash hit albeit significally downgraded from the arcades. i mean on one hand this game gets props for being like the founder of the modern fighting game genre so it has that going for it but on the other the games kinda slow to play compared to its newer couterparts, which is honestly ok. the ai is a cheating bastard though, same as it always was, had to start somewhere i guess. i think you could learn how to play this to get a sort of foundational grasp of fighting games at a slow comprehensible pace. some people might think im a bit oldheaded for suggesting that but idk it worked for me personally. you could probably do that with super turbo instead though so take what i say with a grain of salt, i aint no competitive player. overall game machines good, shoutouts to streets def wayyyyyyyyy better than the first but its not too fun for me the game that started the phenomenon and its good still. but why would you ever want to play this version over any of the others it is best remembered for its significance, that is all really. in fifth grade, this was my path into connecting with my classmates.",4300.0,11.0,158.0,99.0,3.578100376382547,1.595959595959596,1991

A heavily altered port was produced for the Famicom/NES (without Kojima's involvement). A remade version based on the original MSX2 game was released as a bonus game in Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence for the PlayStation 2 and, as a result, is also included in Metal Gear Solid HD Collection and Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection.
             

              The game revolves around a special forces operative codenamed Solid Snake who goes into a solo infiltration mission into the fortified state of Outer Heaven to destroy Metal Gear, a bipedal walking tank capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the world.
             

              The player must navigate the main character, a military operative codenamed Solid Snake, through various locations, while avoiding visual contact and direct confrontation with patrolling guards. If the player is seen, the game enters the ""Alert Mode."" In this situation, Snake must escape from enemy's sight in order to resume infiltration. The method of escaping varies depending on the circumstances behind discovery:
             

              If Snake is seen and only a single exclamation mark appears over an enemy's head, only the enemies in the player's present screen will attack and Snake can escape by simply moving to an adjacent screen.
              
              However, if two exclamation marks appear over the enemy (or the player triggers an alarm by being spotted by a camera, infrared sensor or by using an unsuppressed weapon), reinforcements from off-screen will appear as well. Snake can only escape by eliminating all incoming enemies, going outdoors, or by entering an elevator.
              
              The player starts the game unarmed, but eventually acquires firearms such as a Beretta 92F and an M79 grenade launcher, as well as explosives such as remote control missiles and landmines. Ammo and supplies for weapons are limited, but are replenished by picking up ammunition caches or additional supplies. Weapons can not only be used to kill enemies, but also to clear obstacles such as hollow walls and electrified floors. Snake can also use his fists to punch and defeat patrolling enemies. Occasionally, if the player defeats a guard with punches without alerting anyone, the defeated guard will yield a single unit of rations or an ammo box that can be picked up. In addition to enemy guards, the player will also be confronted by mercenaries who will challenge the player to combat, serving as the boss characters.
             

              The enemy base consists of three different buildings, with multiple floors (including basement levels) within them. The player uses key cards and other items to unlock doors and explore new areas. Each door will only open to its corresponding key cards. Information can be obtained by rescuing hostages being held within the buildings. After rescuing five hostages, the player's rank will increase by one star (with the maximum rank being four stars), allowing for increased carrying capacity and maximum health. However, if a hostage is killed, the player is demoted to the previous rank.
             

              A transceiver is available for the player to communicate with their commanding officer, Big Boss, or one of the resistance members operating covertly near Outer Heaven (Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer). Each of Snake's allies specializes in a specific subject. The player must keep track of their allies' frequency numbers in order to contact them. All of the radio messages are dependent on the rooms where the player is located.","this wouldve been better if lupin iii was there absolutely incredible game, with elements i never could imagine being implemented in 1987. truthfully, save states are why i was able to fully enjoy the game, as the amount of deaths and where it sends you back definitely gets very tedious and can completely ruin the experience. ive tried so many times with this game for so many years, each time saying this is the time, this time ill finally beat msx metal gear and every time i stop because the game is genuinely unfun, frustrating, obtuse and... kinda bad honestly theres a glimmer of something great hiding in here, i imagine a fan patch that irons out some of the kinks would make this much more enjoyable but as it is, metal gear 1 on the msx is an archaic mess that would be forgotten entirely had it not been for the legacy it left behind as one of the earliest stealth games, and the first metal gear game maybe ill go back to this game again in another year or 2, and maybe thats the time ill finally do it. ill finally beat metal gear for the msx neat and dated humble beginnings for the franchise. short and sweet which helps. honestly worth a play just for the novelty, since it doesnt really overstay its welcome and its neat to see where the franchise all began. the card key nonsense does kinda become annoying, though. se eu ver um card na minha frente de novo eu mato alguém lacking in the gay sex variety",1900.0,29.0,539.0,213.0,3.325633203595264,2.5305164319248825,1987

The shooting mechanism uses a much larger reticule that turns from green to red when an enemy is targeted as opposed to a very narrow laser sight, a ""quick knife"" command is added that auto-targets the nearest enemy or object, and motion sensitive quick time event prompts are included as well as button presses.
             

              Visually the game is on par with the original GameCube version as opposed to the somewhat inferior graphics of the PlayStation 2 version, although in very few instances the inferior PS2 graphics are mistakenly retained such as herbs having lower detail models in some places. The Wii version also supports the Wii's Classic Controller, which reverts aiming and the laser sight back to the original format. The only other noticeable differences are that the game seems significantly easier, and that all of Leon's actions appear to move slightly faster.","easily the best version of re4, playing with the wiimote has never felt this satisfying for any game ever the game itself is still a hood classic, the perfect blend of action and horror but i feel like it leans more to the action side, which isnt really a bad thing but that influenced the newer games to being way too actionoriented some bosses are pretty boring and ashley is annoying at times but overall this is still a great game to playthrough, definitely stood the test of time imo this version of the game makes it hard to go back to the other versions of re4. the wii edition improves on the aiming by ten folds. turning an already amazing game to perfection. one of the best games of all time. the perfect blend of action and horror with amazing combat and gameplay and so much content and replayability. the music is great, the story is amazing for the style it went for, and the world just fits so well. there is such iconic scenes, enemies, and character that all ooze personality and charm. this is my favorite game of all time, and ive played it multiple times on ps2, gamecube, wii, pc, the old pc version, xsx, and probably more versions that im forgetting. i love this game, and i think even with the remake people should still play the original. especially this version. this version with the amazing aiming is wonderful, and i think that if you arent going to play the pc version, play this one. it is the best motion controlled shooter out there. not much i can say that hasnt been said before, but yeah its pretty clear why this is considered one of the greats in gaming. very rough in some areas and felt very funny going through this on a wii havent touched one in 4ish years, but after a while it just felt right. i will note that despite the typical stuff thats brought up as being the worst parts of this game like ashley or the constant quicktime events i never had much of an issue with these. instead my least favorite segments are never brought up like ive never heard anyone talk about this u3 fight. bosses can be hit or miss, but nothing feels quite as good as mowing down hordes with the shotgun or riding on the back of a bulldozer firing an smg. ill have to sit on it before i consider it a favorite but its certainly up there. its just hard to hate this kinda game. best version of the game. masterpiece salute",1100.0,16.0,213.0,76.0,3.842630202412493,2.8026315789473686,2007

A Sega Game Gear game, of the same name and genre, Ristar, was also released, which shared similar themes while possessing different level design and gameplay mechanics. The game stars an anthropomorphic cartoon star who uses his hands and long, stretchable arms to both move and combat enemies. Reception for the game has been generally positive, but the game's initial release was overshadowed due to the imminent ending of the Genesis's lifecycle and the succession of the Sega Saturn and other fifth generation video game consoles. While never receiving any sequels, Sega has re-released the game a number of times digitally and on Sega-themed compilations, and has occasionally given Ristar himself cameos in other Sega properties.","complete playthrough on hard difficulty, including all bonus stages completed. while i wouldnt say that i loved ristar , its undeniably impressive in a number of ways. a lesserknown 2d mascot platformer, it has some quite unusual mechanics, with the protagonist, an anthropomorphised star, using his extensible arms to help with navigating stages and basic combat through a grab move. bright, vibrantlycoloured graphics across a range of creativelydesigned environments are consistently attractive, and the levels themselves are each quite expansive in both dimensions. sadly, some frustrations in controls hold the game back from true greatness, particularly so in the later stages and bosses  but at least with the benefits of emulation, those can be someone alleviated. ristar is a crown jewel of the genesis collection. vibrant art, cohesive level themes, creative bosses, a bopping soundtrack, and great applications of a grapple make this game sing. level themes are mostly traditional, but all are suited to ristars moves and pace. shifts in momentum make more sense than in most platformers and even swimming and ice levels are fun rather than frustrating. its overly demanding of reflexes, especially in the late game, but thats just a spot of tarnish. if this came out today by an indie studio, it would have been praised for its creativity. in 1995, its likely that ristar was ignored as just another mascot platformer  a damn shame, as this the definition of a hidden gem. a slightly more methodical but solid platformer from the tailend of the mega drive. it suffers from some bonkers random difficulty spikes across but the level design is creative. ive heard several ways to pronounce the name of this game over the years. personally, ive always said ryestar, though reestar also makes sense as both pronunciations refer to the fact that ristar is a star. if you say wrister because he grabs things with this wrists  then youre demonic. identify yourselves in the comments and submit yourself to gamer reeducation me yelling at you. i love this game. i wish i had something more meaningful to say but god i love this game. i love all killer no filler genesis platformers that pack so much into such a lovely little package of 6 stages. i love these jewel oranges and purples. i love water levels with the courtesy to let you move faster. i love building up as much speed as possible while pole swinging and then pinballing myself across the stage without a care in the world. i love snowball fights, conducting concerts and hugging my dad.",1200.0,12.0,355.0,175.0,3.6354200748751966,2.0285714285714285,1995

The player can move along platforms, as well as jump to those above and to the side, similar to most platform games.
             

              The player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. Bubbles that contain enemies can be popped at the same time resulting in different foods being projected around the level. Each enemy trapped in a bubble equates to a different food. Food is consumed and transferred to points (an increasing scale of 1000 points is awarded for each enemy burst in tandem with another meaning: one enemy burst equals one food item worth 1000 points, two enemies burst equals two food items worth 1000 and 2000 points, three enemies burst equals three food items worth 1000, 2000 and 4000 points, and so on), which results in earning lives. These same bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated.
             

              Enemies turn ""angry"" — becoming pink-colored and moving faster — if they are the last enemy remaining, escape from a bubble after being left too long or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level. A monster will also become angry if either player collects a skull (the only negative item in the game), and the monster is hit by the resulting comet crossing the screen (however, this is a rare occurrence).

Featuring three complete games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the MGS franchise. The ""Metal Gear Solid (MGS)"" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.","neat collection of remakes of 3 mgs games. comes with mgs2, mgs3, and mgs peace walker hd. 2 and 3 use the substance and subsistance versions of the games, so most of the bonus content from those versions is included in this collection, including the msx bonus games in mgs3, so really this could be considered a 5 game collection. unfortunately, theres not too much in the way of bonus extra content that a lot of other compilation titles like to do, its pretty much a menu to select between the 3 games and thats it. the games in this collection are still excellent, and this is a wonderful way to be able to access them. please konami put this on modern platforms with mgs1 and guns of the patriots so people dont have to buy a ps3 to play one the greatest game series of all time the metal gear solid series is easily among my favorite in all of gaming. i have sunk countless hours into the various games in the series and i truly love everything about each game. so i was super excited to play through both mgs2 and mgs3 portably on the vita, and the games didnt disappoint at all both were the same games i had played on other systems, but being able to take them on the go was great. they looked great, played great, and the inclusion of trophy support was a nice touch. the only negative with the vita collection was that it didnt include peace walker, which would have been such a nice bonus. that said, what was here was incredible. definitely one of the best games on the vita if not the best. deserves 5 stars alone for making peace walker playable la colección que petó mi playstation 3 1010 i have beat these games so many times so to get them in hd and there best versions is amazing. if you havent played these games i highly recommend them they still hold up very well.",1500.0,31.0,464.0,230.0,3.8309401256032958,2.017391304347826,2011

Mario and friends are invited to the Baseball Kingdom to play games against each other. When Bowser hears this, he immediately interrupts the party.
             

              There are several game modes to choose from like in the previous game. In Exhibition mode, players play a single game against each other. Players can choose different options such as how many innings to play, if captains can use star powers (each captain has a different star swing and pitch), and toggle error items off and on (error items can be thrown at fielders).
             

              The single-player Challenge mode is different this time around. Instead of choosing a team captain, players start with Mario who must find teammates to take on Bowser Jr. and Bowser. Teammates aren't unlocked by playing a game rather they only join the team by clearing certain objectives. Most of the action takes place on areas with an overhead perspective; each area is based around a team captain. Each captain has a special ability to find teammates and coins, which are used to buy items to aid in the quest or in a game against Bowser Jr. or later against Bowser. More coins can be gotten in minigames.
             

              Toy Field mode is slightly different to the one featured in Mario Superstar Baseball. Like in the GameCube game, players take turns batting to get points; a turn is granted to whomever grabs and holds the ball after a certain amount of time has passed. Unlike in the previous game, however, fielders can attack each other to steal the ball away from whomever has it. The batter can also throw items at the fielders to cause them to drop the ball and grant the batter another turn.","make another mario baseball game its baseball but with all of the standard mario fun packed in. i never played the original so i wouldnt know if its better or worse, but this game is good, not amazing but good. shake the wii remote the game. i liked this game a lot when i was a kid, but when i came back to it with my brother and we realized just how much wagglin we were really doing it took a bit of the excitement away. the game is also pretty broken in terms of game balance, its wayyyy too easy to crack home run after home run. i think the presentation of the game is cool though, the roster has a lot of interesting characters to make your team out of, and you can even play during both the day and night which i always thought was cool. the stadiums to play in are super unique with fun gimmicks and aesthetics in each of them. its a fun mario baseball game, but not as good as its predecessor. this is the only sports game i actually enjoy. i have so many memories of playing this as a kid with my younger brother each moment was bliss any game that i had fun with as a kid and that my friends still enjoy playing today already starts at 3 and a half stars for me. this game has so much love put into it and it is amazing how much fun can be had when there is really only one game mode i care about. this game has a great roster and there are so many hidden gems such as toadsworth. as soon as i learned how good of a pitcher he is i managed to piss off my friend so bad that he jumped on me in real life. you can play without rng, but having a little bit is a fun way to add some variety to the game and get angry reactions from friends which is always fun. even the single player campaign is fun. my friends who grew up with it get a lot more out of it than anyone new to the game. other party games that i have feel more accesable to new players. that is a very minor gripe, however, and the game still deserves a very high rating. good game, but not as good as super mario baseball from gamecube",1800.0,4.0,133.0,81.0,3.665693206745006,1.6419753086419753,2008

more of a bad boy type at the beginning, while he slowly shows that he is actually pretty good. its quite a shame that, on the english version, they gave him the most annoying voice possible well, to be frank that goes to the hyena boss. his voice in japan is minami takayama, mostly known for voicing envy in fma and hajime hinata in danganronpa, and she fits the character perfectly. and i do like the idea of a rogue company besically taking the mantle of hunting mavericks as the hunters are still on the process of rebuilding themselves, and x is going through.... a weird justification to not fighting which im sure its because x is so broken gameplaywise that hed make the game as easy as possible, so they have to hold him out for as long as possible. as for the gameplay... uh. yeah, this is bad. theres no way around it. the camera angles are bad, zero is just bad in general, x is too op, and axl.... is fine, actually. it really feels like they were making this game specifically for axl, considering the enemy placements and how they behave. heck, axl plays so fine he has a dodge roll. truly a dark souls moment. still, the absolute dread of saving the reploids when most of them are in the worst possible spot, and having to deal with enemies that just have too much hp.... its like mmx5, but miles worse. and as much as i praise the plot.... they still have to have sigma as the

two sides of the same coin with x6 being a really bad difficult game while x7 is a really bad easy game and besides x7s others problems when it comes to just that i would take x6 from a mile away. dont get me wrong i adore easy games kirby is one of if not my favorite nintendo franchise, but the thing is that kirby even at its worst can be kind of fun meanwhile this game i just did not have fun specially with its atrocious level designs with every single stage feeling like a weird gimmick the way they handled 3d was horrible, i know the way they couldnt handle the shooting with how its in the 3d like doing something like the zelda n64 duology with z targeting, but with this game it makes it just ridiculously easy all of mm is about directing your shots and while i have not tried the legends games from the little gameplay ive seen i feel like they did 3d mega man right, and that was years before x7. one way they could have done shooting was like ratchet  clank just having some sort of crosshair, the thing is the way they made 3d just does not work at all they made the camera look up instead of behind the player yk like how a fucking 3d game that works, and the thing is the 2d doesnt even fucking work in this game with enemies still acting in a 3d environment it makes it a pain in the ass dealing with enemies that the lockon barely works with enemies that are in the background or foreground its so fucking bad and makes me realize that x7 has the most bland level design when it comes to 2d legit the last stages are almost as difficult as the opening stages from x16 its really dumb and ridiculously easy for it, honestly i could go on with the story, character misinterpretation or newcomers i fucking hate axl, but im just tired of talking about this game this is the most dogshit game i have played and if you want to be like me and play every x game please just skip this game if you want to play the mega man x games because they are something i really adore

The main designer and programmer for this game was Mark Turmell. Midway had previously released such sports games as Arch Rivals in 1989, High Impact in 1990, and Super High Impact in 1991. The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.
              
              The game became exceptionally popular, and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release, creating revenue of $1 billion in quarters. In early 1994, the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.
              
              The release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz), and hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge).","the console ports of this game dont suffer from the coinmunching syndrome that is plagueing the arcade. fun to play especially against another human, otherwise the ai cheats way too much to make it fun for long. i cannot, and will never, condone an arcade game that is asking you for more money even when you win. u will never find a better basketball game maybe nba street but never forget where u came from there was a local restaurant called shillelaghs that had this game as an arcade cabinet when i was a kid. i didnt even like the food really. i would just want to go to play the game. i didnt even like basketball. just that good of a game. had loads of fun with this gem of a basketball game. i always played as the wolf player. que excelente era cuando lo mejor que habia en cuanto a multijugador de a 4 se trataba, era un juego de basquet sin reglas reales y con personajes que podían saltar 10 metros. eramos felices y no lo sabíamos",847.0,0.0,64.0,23.0,3.6435692587685846,2.782608695652174,1993

so while it was flawed and frustrating, it kind of got a pass. we all thought that it had promise and it sure was unfortunate that the gba version never manifested. the second game riskys revenge was more like a tech demo than an actual game, but releasing it as dsiware meant that it didnt need to really be more of that. in the end, it had a bit of overworld, two dungeons, and a weirdly boring shmup section before the final boss. no joking i played through this game twice, several years apart, and i literally dozed off during the mermaid shmup part both times. truly, this series just needed a chance to get a new, real, release that would let it stretch its psuedometroidvania wings and be an amazing game well, we moreorless got that with pirates curse. while the metroidvania aspects were still very simplistic  the world was broken up into several islands, most of which had extremely linear maps  the new pirate abilities were much more fun and easy to use than the old transformations, so it was still fun to backtrack through the islands to find hidden items. the series is closer to a sidescrolling zelda, now that i think about it, since there are the dungeons that are separate from the overworld and dont require a revisit unless you happen to miss something. at the time, i among others thought that they still needed to make the next step towards a proper metroidvania and theyd truly have something. then there was halfgenie hero. first off, it was weird that they began the kickstarter for this game after pirates curse had been announced, but before it actually released. we had only played the original game and riskys revenge at this point, and had the promise of pirates curse releasing within a year or two. additionally, the asyetunreleased pirates curse had the best character art in the series thanks to inticreates aiding with parts of the game as well as the best pixel art, hgh went with more of a chibistyled, smooth style. still, more shantae was more shantae, and it felt like the series was finally getting its due even if the fans had to pay for some of the development. ultimately, though, the game was closer to a mega man x entry than the earlier games metroidvaniasidescrolling zelda style. there was no overworld with dungeons, but instead several independent platforming stages that you would select from a list. as with the mmx games, you could return to completed stages with new abilities to find more powerups. unlike the mmx games, though, in which you get both permanent upgrades helmet, boots, etc. and special weapons you can easily swap between, shantae has to stop and do a transformation dance in order to use her new abilities. it leads to a slower, less fun, platforming experience and i was ultimately disappointed in the game. finally, this leads us to seven sirens. we finally got what we wanted, in a monkeys paw sort of way. theres a full, interconnected, metroidvania map now ...but there are also the zeldalike dungeons that are independent of each other and the overworld. while some of these have been fun in earlier games, the dungeons i played in ss are very simple and straightforward. id rather have just the connected map with more interesting platforming and puzzles. additionally, early on you get an ability that reveals secrets, ranging from gems money to hidden platforms. the unfortunate part is that you get a visual notification on every screen in which there is something hidden, which is basically almost every screen, requiring you to stop and use the ability to try and find whatever it is. most of the time, its nothing special, and this power also uses mana or whatever, so you need to fill it up after using it several times. all that to say that the series has come close to greatness, but never quite reaches it, and the best entry is now lost in the middle of a bunch of mediocreatbest games. i debate back and forth whether or not i like this or pirates curse more. i like the change to one single open metroidvania world when compared to the separate segmented ones of the past. the way transformations work is probably the best in the series with how seamless and fluid they are, but the dances feel a bit lame. theres so many different rooms where you can use them and most of the time theres nothing more than gems that you get out of them. i found the gameplay balancing to be a a bit out of wack as well. i played on the definitive mode that the game recommends and found the game much, much harder at the beginning. you are starved for healing items and resources, which made the beginning parts a lot more challenging than anything later. but by about 33 through the game i had more than enough money to keep myself capped on all of the healing items. the progression feels a bit too formulaic as well, with the game constantly switching between having you find x amount of mcguffins and then doing a dungeon and then repeating till the end. that said, i enjoyed the game overall. the world is fun to explore, the powers are interesting and the music is great. mixing the pirates curse and halfgenue forbids, this game makes for a fun time. while not as fluid as other titles, the focus is in the metroidvania aspect this time. an enjoyable game with an alright story. some of the writing was kind of funny, and the art was nice, but other than that it felt pretty phonedin. thank goodness we have another metroidvaniastyle shantae game, and this time its the classic kind. in terms of presentations this is easily the best in the saga, the overworld graphics and the portraits be looking pretty cute, and although the music may be the weakest in the saga, it has some catchy tunes. as for gameplay, they finally fixed the transformations problem, even if theyre still not as good as the pirate gear in pirates curse its a step in the right direction. the game is great and a lot of fun, but it has some problems. the bosses are pretty bad, most of them consisting of dodging a sequence of three attacks and then hitting them for a while, rinse and repeat, although a couple of them are admittedly fun. the animated sequences look pretty rough too, but its a noble concept that i hope to see expanded in later games. finally, good god, trying to beat this game with 100 completion is a freaking chore, as most of the items you need are hidden or in a location that hasnt been relevant in a while, and there being no markers on the map to remember where they are is a missed opportunity. either way, its a pretty good game, the second best in the series, so if you liked

A. Salvatore. Brought to life visually through the trademark visceral style of renowned artist and Spawn creator Todd McFarlane, Reckoning brings a new level of intense action combat to the RPG genre.","as the first rpg that introduced me to the genre, it holds a special nostalgic place in my heart. funny enough, ive played more jrpgs after playing this one that going back to it, it feels rather odd in comparison. still though, i love the game and i hold fondly of the time i have spent on it as a middle schooler. wish it performed better financially there are some movies and tv shows that im convinced only really hit if you watch them at a certain age. it is my firm belief that if you havent watched star trek, mean girls, or the breakfast club before the age of 18, you will never understand or enjoy these things at least, i did not. similarly, i think some games are appreciated more if they come at a certain time in your life. kingdoms of amalur reckoning is one of those games. this game would have been really cool if i had played it when i was 1012 it was not out in the mid00s, and there was no way the graphic violence would have gotten past my moms onewoman censorship board. it would probably be pretty cool if i was in college and played it while listening to lectures or something. however, as a grown man, this game feels very basic and boring. first offender is the combat. the combat is in real time, and feels close to dragons dogma or scarlet nexus, if you are familiar with those games. the combat in amalur has the twin drawbacks of being barebones and stiff. there is only one basic attack no lightheavy attacks or parries, a dodge that feels awkward to use, a range attack that quickly runs out of ammo and seems quite pointless, and a set of spells that can be customized. the spells are kind of cool, but they, cant really be chained into combos,. there is also a super saiyan mode that can be built up by filling up your ragedevil triggerswhatever instead of making you superpowered for a small amount of time like dmc or giving you access to a massive attack that can curbstomp multiple enemies at once like blades of time, it gives you the change to attack one enemy with a super special attack that gives you extra exp. combat in this game has no depth and feels like a repetitive chore the lack of a parry, a decent dodge, or any combos beyond your basic tap x sequence is keenly felt. the swift, exciting, and somewhat openended combat of devil may cry has spoiled me, i suppose. it is true that there are some combos that you can unlock in the game, but i didnt find the ones that i unlocked useful. additionally, you also have to use perk points to unlock them only for specific weapons. realize that the hammer sucks and want to use a greatsword too bad, youve put all of your points into the hammer. it is true that you can respec later on, but this kind of game would have benefitted from a skyrimstyle system where you level up weapons ability based on using the weapon. the story is your usual highfantasy bafflegarble its not great, but im usually fairly lenient on bad stories as long as they arent shoved in your face by cinematic cutscenes. the dialogue choices tend to be pointless and apparently you can use persuasion skills to steamroll past everything. i highly dislike dialogue choices in games where they do not make a difference or make very little difference developers and writers need to have confidence in the story that they are telling. the open world is a series of poorlydisguised corridors with the occasional boring dungeon. the game feels less open than an n64 zelda, and even the map clearly shows the corridors. thus, theres no real exploration in the game not that there is any real point to the exploration anyway. i found nothing about the enemy designs, world, or other art to be at all interesting. the semicartoony art style clashed with the occasional graphic violence of the game. every npc has a thousand dialogue keywords that you can choose from, and none of them are interesting. the loot system was not engaging or addicting there was no way to easily compare stats for new items vs equipped items, and given the fact that combat felt like a chore, i didnt really feel excited to upgrade my gear. i am barely interested in smithing, crafting, alchemy etc. in most games, and in any case skyrim did all of these better than amalur. everything about this game just felt like busywork. i could probably forgive one or more mediocre elements of this game if they combined to create an immersive and interesting whole, but amalur just feels like fantasy game the game. everything in the game feels very much like a video game element. i dont know if this makes sense, but it describes the sense i felt while playing it. it was the opposite of skyrim, a game that, while it contains clunky and repetitive elements, really feels like living in a fantasy world. amalur feels like playing a fantasy game quite appropriately, since it was originally intended to be an mmo and nothing about it grabbed me. in my earlier years i may have been able to ignore its many flaws, but at this point in my life, with so much experience gaming and so many superior choices available, i cant justify playing this game. na verga tis a beauty of a game. i was really satisfied with this, especially considering it came out only a few months after the extremely greybrown skyrim. its basically just skyrim with a much more interesting world and a much deeper combat system. it honestly felt kind of similar to the original god of war games in that way. for a game that got overshadowed by bigger titles its incredibly underrated and deserves more recognition. its a beautiful looking game with so much to explore and do, i loved it for the first 34 of the game. however...when it gets towards the end you find its very half assed, theres a few bugs here and there and it just felt very incomplete. but most of the game is great and there is so much character creation its ridiculous, dlcs were interesting and beautiful looking pieces two. action rpg

              The score counter doubles as a money meter; the player can spend this money on paint jobs and various other things. However, any money spent is of course taken away from the score, making the goal that little bit further away.
             

              On obtaining the target number of points, the player must then drive to a certain location to complete the level, which allows progress to the next one.",its where the series began and calling it rough is kinda sugarcoating it. this game feels like a massive middle finger to the player right from the start and id be surprised if anyone nowadays could get to san andreas without feeling burnt out. i would recommend just playing gta 2 instead. impossível essa merda fart button i tried so hard as a kid to get anywhere in this game and never did. but i kept playing it. existe playstation classic console,1600.0,4.0,225.0,109.0,3.3208137652954686,2.0642201834862384,1997

1493,guitar hero 5,2009-09-01,"Activision , Neversoft Entertainment",3.2,63.0,Music,"Guitar Hero 5 (initially referred to as Guitar Hero V) is a music rhythm game and the fifth main entry in the Guitar Hero series. The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.
             

              Guitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero.
             

              The game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game.","its a game. its guitar hero. if you like guitar hero, you are gonna like this. the setlist is relatively diverse, albiet maybe a bit more leaning towards pop music over metal and rock. i heard beforehand that this game was the straw that apparently broke the camels back and made guitar hero more leaning to casuals, and i can kind of see that but also not really most of the setlist was very easy but the last few songs are still good fun. this game also has a completely revamped graphics engine which looks very good in action, so thats neat. there are also bonus challenges for certain songs that are actually really difficult, so gh maniacs still have fun things to do i feel. overall, its more guitar hero. you cant go wrong with guitar hero, though i can see why constant releases of just more guitar hero would definitely fatigue the audience into the franchises decline. major rhythm game fatigue hit right about here. kurt cobain cantando y.m.c.a. kkkkk muito foda completo this is the installment where even i got tired of the yearly bullshit. not the best but its still fun.",1100.0,0.0,65.0,22.0,3.5977411214936317,2.9545454545454546,2009
